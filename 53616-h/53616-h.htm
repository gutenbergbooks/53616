<p class="par first">Most of the propositions in mythology and
anthropology in this book are founded on bodies of evidence given in
the larger works of the author. It seemed fitting, therefore, to refer
to those works instead of repeating hundreds of references there given.
Readers concerned to investigate the issues are thus invited and
enabled to do so. For brevity&rsquo;s sake, <i>Christianity and
Mythology</i> is cited as <i>C.M.</i>; <i>Pagan Christs</i> as
<i>P.C.</i>; and the <i>Short Histories</i> of Christianity and
Freethought as <i>S.H.C.</i> and <i>S.H.F.</i> respectively. In the
first three cases the references are to the second editions; in the
last case, to the third. <i>The Evolution of States</i> is cited as
<i>E.S.</i> Another work often referred to is Sir J. G. Frazer&rsquo;s
great thesaurus, <i>The Golden Bough</i>, which is cited as
<i>G.B.</i>, the references being to the last edition. Other new
references are given in the usual way. The <i lang="la">Ecce Deus</i>
of Professor W. B. Smith is cited in the English edition.</p>
<p class="par">Passages in brackets, in unleaded type, may be passed at
a first perusal by readers concerned mainly to follow the constructive
theory. Such passages deal controversially with counter-polemic.

<h2 class="label"><span class="sc">Chapter I</span></h2>
<h2 class="main">THE APPROACH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As was explained in the preamble to <span class=
"sc">The Historical Jesus</span> (1916), that work was offered as
prolegomena to a concise restatement of the theory that the Gospel
Jesus is a mythical construction. That theory had been discursively
expounded by the writer in two large volumes, <span class=
"sc">Christianity and Mythology</span> and <span class="sc">Pagan
Christs</span>, and summarily in <span class="sc">A Short History of
Christianity</span>, the argument in the two former combining a
negative criticism of the New Testament narrative with an exposition of
the myth-evidence. Criticism having in large part taken the form of a
denial that the records were unhistorical, it was necessary to clear
the ground by showing that all the various attempts of the past
generation to find in the gospels a historical residuum have entirely
failed to meet critical tests. Those attempts, conflicting as they do
with each other, and collapsing as they do in themselves, give
undesigned support to the conclusion that the gospel story is without
historic basis.</p>
<p class="par">It remains to restate with equal brevity the myth-theory
which, long ago propounded on a very narrow basis, has latterly been
re-developed in the light of modern mythology and anthropology, and has
in recent years <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name=
"pb2">2</a>]</span>found rapidly increasing acceptance. Inevitably the
different lines of approach have involved varieties of speculation;
Professors Drews and W. B. Smith have ably and independently developed
the theory in various ways; and a conspectus and restatement has become
necessary for the sake of the theory itself no less than for the sake
of those readers who call for a condensed statement.</p>
<p class="par">This in turn is in itself tentative. If the progressive
analysis of the subject matter from the point of view of its
historicity has meant a century and a half of debate and an immense
special literature, it is not to be supposed that the theory which
negates the fundamental assumptions of that literature can be fully
developed and established in one lifetime, at the hands of a few
writers. The problem &ldquo;What really happened?&rdquo; is in fact a
far wider one for the advocate of the myth-theory than for the critic
who undertakes to extract a biography from the documents. In its first
form, as propounded by Dupuis and Volney, the myth-theory was confined
simply to certain parallelisms between Christian and Pagan myth, and to
the astronomical basis of a number of these. From this standpoint the
actual historic inception of the cult was little considered. Strauss,
again, developed with great power and precision the view that most of
the detail in the gospel narrative is myth construction on the lines of
Jewish prophecy and dogma. But Strauss never fully accepted the
myth-theory, having always assumed the existence of a teacher as a
nucleus for the whole. As apart from the continuators of Dupuis and
Volney, it was Bruno Bauer who, setting out with the purpose of
extracting a biography from the gospels, and finding no standing
ground, first propounded a myth-theory from that point of view.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">His construction, being the substantially arbitrary one
of a hypothetical evangelist who created a myth and thereby founded the
cultus, naturally made no headway; and its artificiality strengthened
the hands of those who claimed to work inductively on the documents. It
was by reason of a similar failure to find a historic footing where he
had at first taken it for granted that the present writer was gradually
led, on lines of comparative hierology and comparative mythology and
anthropology, to the conception of the evolution of the Jesus-cult from
the roots of a &ldquo;pre-Christian&rdquo; one. The fact that this view
has been independently reached by such a student as Professor W. B.
Smith, who approached the problem from within rather than by way of the
comparative method, seems in itself a very important confirmation.</p>
<p class="par">What is now to be done is to revise the general theory
in the light of further study as well as of the highly important
expositions of it by Professor Smith and other scholars. An attempt is
now definitely made not merely to combine concisely the evidence for a
pre-Christian Jesus-cult, but to show how that historically grew into
&ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; thus substituting a defensible historical
view for a mythic narrative of beginnings. And this, of course, is a
heavy undertaking.</p>
<p class="par">The question, &ldquo;What do you put in its
place?&rdquo; is often addressed to the destructive critic of a belief,
not with any philosophic perception of the fact that complete removal
is effected only by putting a tested or tenable judgment in place of an
untested or untenable one, but with a sense of injury, as if a false
belief were a personal possession, for the removal of which there must
be &ldquo;compensation.&rdquo; In point of fact, the destructive
process is rarely attempted without a coincident process of
substitution. Even to say that a particular text is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>spurious is
to say that some one forged or inserted it where it is, for a purpose.
That concept is &ldquo;something in its place.&rdquo; Some Comtists,
again, are wont to commit the contradiction of affirming that &ldquo;no
belief is really destroyed without replacement,&rdquo; and, in the next
breath, of condemning rationalists who &ldquo;destroy without
replacing.&rdquo; Both propositions cannot stand.</p>
<p class="par">If it be meant merely to insist that explanation is
replacement, and that explanation is a necessary part of a successful
or complete process of destruction, the answer is that it is hardly
possible even to attempt to cancel a belief without putting a different
belief in its place; and that it is nearly always by way of positing a
new belief that an old one is assailed. The old charge against
rationalism, of &ldquo;destroying without building up,&rdquo; is
historically quite false. Almost invariably, the innovator has offered
a new doctrine or conception in place of the old. True, it might not be
ostensibly an equivalent, for the believer who wanted an equivalent in
kind. An exploded God-idea is not for me replaceable by another
God-idea: the only rational &ldquo;replacement&rdquo; is a substitution
of a reasoned for an authoritarian cosmology and ethic. But in the way
of reasoned replacements the innovators have been only too quick, in
general, to formulate new conceptions, new creeds. They have really
been too eager to build afresh, and many untenable formulas and
hypotheses are the consequences.</p>
<p class="par">These very attempts, naturally, are constantly made the
objects of still more hasty counter-attack. Every form of the
myth-theory with which I am acquainted, whatever its defects, has been
the result of much labour, and even if astray can be fairly pronounced
&ldquo;hasty&rdquo; only in the sense that it proves to be inadequate.
It is not so with most of the counter-criticism. The reader
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>may rest assured that it is not possible for any
exposition of the new theory to be as &ldquo;hasty&rdquo; as is usually
its rejection.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e730src" href="#xd23e730"
name="xd23e730src">1</a> Professional theologians who cast that epithet
are in general recognizably men who believed their hereditary creed
before they were able to think, and have at no later stage made good
the first inevitable omission.</p>
<p class="par">Myth-theories, sound or unsound, are the attempts of
students who find the record incredible as history to think out, in the
light of the documents and of comparative mythology and hierology, the
process by which it came to be produced; and even as all myth is but a
form of traditionary error, so any attempt to trace its growth runs the
risk of error. It is one thing to show, for instance, that the
Pentateuch cannot have been written by &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; seen to be
a non-historical figure: it is another thing to settle how the books
were really made. In such cases, the &ldquo;something in the
place&rdquo; of the tradition is to be ascertained only after long and
patient investigation and counter-criticism. So with the investigation
of the fabulous history of early Rome. After several scholars had set
forth grounded doubts, the problem was ably and systematically handled
by the French freethinker Louis de Beaufort in 1738. Early in the
nineteenth century, Niebuhr, confidently undertaking &ldquo;with the
help of God&rdquo; to get at the truth, and falsely disparaging
Beaufort&rsquo;s work as wholly &ldquo;sceptical,&rdquo; effected a
reconstruction which has since been found to be in large measure
unsound, though long acquiesced in by English students.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e739src" href="#xd23e739" name="xd23e739src">2</a> In
such matters there is really no finality. If well-documented history
must in every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>age be rewritten, no less inevitable is the
re-writing of that which is reached only by processes of inference. And
the gospel problem is the hardest of all. Still more than in the case
of the Pentateuch problem, many revisions will probably be needed
before a generally satisfactory solution is reached.</p>
<p class="par">There is nothing for it but to trace and retrace,
consider and reconsider, the inferrible historic process. Met as he is
by alternate charges of reckless iconoclasm and &ldquo;hasty&rdquo;
construction, the proper course for the holder of the myth-theory is to
repeat with dispassionate vigilance both of his processes&mdash;to show
first that the progressive effort to extract from the gospels a tenable
biography has ended in complete critical collapse, revealing only a
tissue of myth; and then to attempt to indicate how the pseudo-history
came to be compiled: in other words, how the myth arose. Such has been
my procedure in the preceding volume and in this.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It may of course be argued that the previous negative
criticism of the gospel record is indecisive; that the avowal of Loisy:
&ldquo;If the trial and condemnation of Jesus, as pretended Messiah,
could be put in doubt, we should have no ground for affirming the
existence of the Christ,&rdquo; does not commit other inquirers, or
that the historicity of the trial story has not really been exploded;
that the nullity of the alleged Evangel has not been established; or
that the complete destruction of previous biographical theories claimed
by Schweitzer for himself and Wrede has not been accomplished. The
answer is that these issues are not re-opened in the following
chapters. They were carefully handled in the previous volume, to which
I have seen no attempt at a comprehensive and reasoned answer.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span></p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">[The latest attack I have seen comes from a former
antagonist, who appears to lay his main complaint against the book on
the ground that it &ldquo;omits to notice <i>the</i> theory of the
synoptic problem which appears in every modern text-book,&rdquo; that
is, &ldquo;the two-documents hypothesis.&rdquo; And there emerges this
indictment:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">As the theory has a vital bearing on the relative
values of different strata of tradition, Mr. Robertson cannot afford to
ignore it. If we apply to himself the crude principle he applies to
Paul and the evangelists, to wit, that if they don&rsquo;t mention a
thing they don&rsquo;t know it, we must assume that Mr. Robertson is
still ignorant of the very elements of the problem he is professing to
solve. Since he has no clear or tenable view of the documents and their
relations to one another, he obviously cannot answer the historical
questions they raise.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e760src" href=
"#xd23e760" name="xd23e760src">3</a>... Presumably he omits to mention
it because he does not see its significance.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e763src" href="#xd23e763" name="xd23e763src">4</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Before coming to the main matter, it is necessary to
elucidate the charge as to a &ldquo;crude principle&rdquo; applied to
Paul and the evangelists. The &ldquo;principle&rdquo; really applied
was this, that if &ldquo;Paul&rdquo; in all his writings, apart from
two interpolated passages, shows no real knowledge whatever of the
gospels, and no knowledge whatever either of the life or the teachings
of Jesus as there recorded, we are compelled to infer either that these
details were not in any form known to Paul, or that, if he knew them,
he did not believe them. It is not a matter of his not knowing
&ldquo;<i>a</i> thing&rdquo;: that is the sophism of the critic; it is
a matter of his not knowing <i>any</i>thing on the subject. And so with
the synoptics and the fourth gospel. When one side relates something
vital to the record, of which the other side shows no knowledge
whatever<a class="noteref" id="xd23e777src" href="#xd23e777" name=
"xd23e777src">5</a>&mdash;as, for instance, great miracles&mdash;we are
bound to infer that the silent side, when it is the earlier record,
either did not know or did not believe <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb8" href="#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>the story. Or, again, when
John alleges that the disciples baptized freely and the synoptics make
no mention of it, it is clear that we cannot suppose them, in the
alleged circumstances, to have been ignorant of such a fact; while, if
they are supposed to have known it and yet to have kept silence, their
credit as historians is gravely shaken. The &ldquo;principle,&rdquo; in
fact, is that of critical common-sense; and the critic&rsquo;s version
of it is a forensic perversion.</p>
<p class="par">On the next issue, it is perhaps well to explain to the
lay reader that the &ldquo;two-documents hypothesis&rdquo; is simply
what Schmiedel&mdash;with a very justifiable implication&mdash;named
&ldquo;the <i>so-called</i> theory of two sources,&rdquo; a mere aspect
of &ldquo;the borrowing hypothesis&rdquo; which constitutes the main
substance of the bulk of the documentary discussion of the gospels in
the last century, and which is simply the most obvious way of
attempting to explain the documentary phenomena. It dates from Papias.
As the critic asseverates, it is <i>the</i> theory of the text-books in
general. And for the <i>main</i> purposes of historic comprehension, it
is neither here nor there. The theory of two sources cannot possibly
cover all the data, even from the biographical point of view. The
effect of Schmiedel&rsquo;s article&mdash;a model of critical honesty
and general good sense which his successors might usefully strive to
copy in those regards&mdash;is to show that the hypothesis is quite
inadequate even as a <i>documentary</i> theory; and from the point of
view of the rational student it is simply neutral to the vital
question, What really did happen, in the main? He who has realized that
the Entry, the Betrayal, the Last Supper, the Agony, the Trials, and
the Crucifixion, are all as mythical as the Resurrection, is not <i>at
that point</i> concerned with the dispute as to priority among the
gospels, or any sections of them. <i>No</i> documentary hypothesis can
possibly make the myth true.</p>
<p class="par">At the vital point, in fact, the two-documents
hypothesis is not even ostensibly applicable: the synoptic narrative is
<i>one</i> primary narrative, subjected to minor modifications. It is
admitted by Harnack to have been absent from &ldquo;Q,&rdquo; the
<i lang="grc-latn">Logoi</i> &ldquo;source&rdquo; held to have been
drawn upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>by Matthew and Luke. And that one narrative, as I
have argued, is not in origin a &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; narrative at all,
but the simple transcript of a mystery-drama, with almost the minimum
of necessary narrative insertion. If the exegete could bring himself to
contemplate rationally <i>my</i> hypothesis, he might find his
documentary labours lightened.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e819src" href=
"#xd23e819" name="xd23e819src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">It is doubtless true that the determination of the
earlier as against the later form of a minor narrative episode, or of a
teaching, is often essential to the framing of a true notion as to its
mode of entrance; and such determination I have attempted many times.
But the notion that historicity is a matter of priority of documents
is, as Schmiedel sees, the fallacy of fallacies. Prisoned in that
presupposition, exegetes defending the record achieve inevitably the
very failure they impute: they are &ldquo;ignorant of the very elements
of the problem they are professing to solve&rdquo;&mdash;that is, the
problem of what really happened. They cannot realize the conditions
under which the gospels were compiled. They construct what they think a
&ldquo;clear <i>or</i> tenable&rdquo; view of the documents by the
process of evading the considerations which make it <i>un</i>tenable or
inadequate, and then demand that their documentary formula shall be met
by one <i lang="la">in pari materia</i>. The answer to them is that
their psychological as well as their historical assumptions are false.
Things did not happen in that way. And two versions of a palpable myth
do not make for its historicity. There are two or more versions of most
myths.</p>
<p class="par">The indictment before us, in short, is an illustration
of the mode of theological fence discussed above. You undertake to show
that the most alert presentments of a given historical conception fail
to stand critical tests, and you are met with the reply: &ldquo;We are
not concerned to discuss the presentments you deal with, which are not
generally accepted: we demand that you discuss <span class=

the documentary theory which in those presentments is treated as
obsolete. If you do not do this, you show you are incompetent.&rdquo;
When on the other hand the critical significance of an older theory is
indicated, the reply is made that that theory is
&ldquo;obsolete.&rdquo; One theory is too new, another is too old, for
discussion. All the while, the theory founded-on for the defence is
really the oldest of all. It was in fact the obvious inadequacy of the
familiar documentary hypothesis that dictated our discussion of more
up-to-date theories, as it had elicited these. If our exegete&rsquo;s
favourite hypothesis had had any power of satisfying independent
students, we should not have had such treatises as those of the Rev.
Dr. Wright and Dr. Flinders Petrie, or the searching analysis and
commentary of M. Loisy, to say nothing of the vigorous Dr. Blass.</p>
<p class="par">In dealing with such writers, and particularly in
following the &ldquo;real&rdquo; procedure of M. Loisy on the main
issues of historical fact, I took what seemed to me the candid
controversial course. To resort instead to a mere exposure of the
obvious insufficiency of the &ldquo;two-documents hypothesis&rdquo;
would be like arguing as if Genesis were the only alternative to the
Darwinian theory. Dr. Wright&rsquo;s &ldquo;oral hypothesis&rdquo; is a
vivid and interesting revival of what, as I pointed out, had long ago
been the &ldquo;predominant&rdquo; view.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e845src" href="#xd23e845" name="xd23e845src">7</a> Our exegete
nevertheless affirms that I regard it &ldquo;as something new in
England.&rdquo; To the lay reader I would again explain the situation
thus handled. Theological discussion on the gospels has moved in
cycles, by reason of the invariable presupposition as to historicity,
which was a main factor in the partial failure of the mythical theory
as introduced by Strauss. As I expressly stated, the oral hypothesis
was before Strauss &ldquo;well established.&rdquo; Then ensued the
age-long discussion of documentary hypotheses. At the close of the
nineteenth century we find Schmiedel saying:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Lastly, scholars are also <i>beginning to
remember</i> that the evangelists did not need to draw their material
from books alone, but that from youth up they were acquainted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>with it from oral narration and could easily
commit it to writing precisely in this form in either
case&mdash;whether they had it before them in no written form, or
whether they had it in different written form. In this matter, again,
we are beginning to be on our guard against the error of supposing that
in the synoptical problem we have to reckon merely with given
quantities, or with such as can be easily ascertained.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e856src" href="#xd23e856" name=
"xd23e856src">8</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">If I had written that, I should doubtless be told that I
regarded the oral hypothesis as &ldquo;new.&rdquo; Dr. Schmiedel, it is
to be hoped, may escape the aspersive method of my critic. In point of
fact, a return to the oral hypothesis was inevitable in view of the
insufficiency of the other. Unfortunately it has been made on the old
and fatal presupposition of the historicity of the myth; but, as made
by Dr. Wright, it seemed well worth critical consideration. My critic
disparages that and other propaganda as &ldquo;commanding no
<i>large</i> measure of assent anywhere.&rdquo; My testimony, I fear,
will not help Dr. Wright; but I will say that I found him an honest and
extremely interesting writer, admirably free from theological malice,
and above all exhibiting a thoroughly independent hold of his thesis.
What amount of assent he has secured is an irrelevant issue. I can only
say that I found him very readable. The scholarly and intellectual
status of Dr. Flinders Petrie, again, is such as perhaps to make it
unnecessary to say&mdash;as against similar disparagement in his
case&mdash;that a thesis seriously and vigorously embraced by him as
superseding the older documentary and oral hypotheses alike, seemed to
me well entitled to consideration.]</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The examination of the recent positions of independent
writers seeking to construct a documentary theory has, I think,
sufficed to safeguard the honest lay student of the myth-theory against
the kind of spurious rebuttal set up by those who, themselves innocent
of all original research, pretend that the fundamental historicity of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>the gospels is established by a &ldquo;consensus
of scholarship.&rdquo; There is no consensus of scholarship. I observe
that M. Loisy, to whom I devoted special study, is journalistically
disparaged by the Very Rev. Dean Inge. That disparagement&mdash;which,
I also observe, I have the undeserved honour to share&mdash;will not
impose upon serious students, who will realize that Dean Inge, himself
transparently unorthodox, has no resource in such matters but to
disparage all who labour with any measure of rational purpose to put
concrete conclusions where church dignitaries inevitably prefer to
maintain rhetorical mystification. For the purposes of serious
students, M. Loisy is an important investigator, Dean Inge a negligible
essayist.</p>
<p class="par">It is true that one of the positions I
discussed&mdash;that of the school of Weiss&mdash;is not
&ldquo;new.&rdquo; But in that case the reason for selection was not
merely that it was one of the efforts to reach something less neutral
than the &ldquo;two-documents hypothesis,&rdquo; but that it is in
substance the position of some of the most recent and most virulent
English critics of the myth-theory. It is in fact the gist of the
polemic of Dr. Conybeare. I have shown, accordingly, that the thesis of
a primary biography is psychologically absurd in itself; and, further,
that like all the other documentary hypotheses it has been left high
and dry by the latest German exegetes, who, expressly assuming the
historicity of a Jesus, and founding on the gospels for their case,
reduce these to a minimum of tradition at which M. Loisy must stand
aghast. It is in England, in short, that the biographical school, as
represented by Dean Inge and Dr. Conybeare, is seen to be most entirely
out of touch with the movement of rational criticism.</p>
<p class="par">It is in England, too, that we find the most uncritical
reliance put upon the &ldquo;impression of a personality&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>said to be set up by the gospels. This argument is
still used without any attempt at psychological self-analysis, any
effort to find out what an impression is worth. A generation or two
ago, exactly the same position was taken up in regard to the fourth
gospel: both the Arnolds, for instance, were confident that the vision
of Jesus there given was peculiarly real. Critical study has since
forced all save the sworn traditionalists and the mere compromisers to
the conclusion that it cannot be real if there is any substantial truth
in the presentment of the synoptics. Slowly it has been realized that
the methods which produce a vivid impression of
&ldquo;personality&rdquo; are methods open to fictive art, and differ
only in detail from the methods of the Bhagavat G&icirc;ta or the
methods of Homer. If a strong impression of a personality be a
certificate of historicity, what of Zeus and H&ecirc;r&ecirc;,
Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; and Achilles, Ulysses and Nestor? Most critics who
handle the problem seem to work <i lang="la">in vacuo</i>, without
regard to the phenomena and the machinery of fictive literature in
general, even when they are moved to accept a hypothesis of
fiction.</p>
<p class="par">The vision presented in the fourth gospel is <i lang=
"la">prima facie</i> more lifelike than that of the synoptics, because
its main author is more of an artist than his predecessors. It has been
justly affirmed by Professor W. B. Smith that</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">The received notion that in the early Marcan
narratives the Jesus is distinctly human, and that the process of
deification is fulfilled in John, is precisely the reverse of the
truth. In Mark there is really no man at all: the Jesus is God, or at
least essentially divine, throughout. He wears only a transparent
garment of flesh. Mark historizes only. Matthew also historizes and
<i>faintly humanizes</i>. Luke more <i>strongly humanizes</i>; while
John not only <i>humanizes</i> but begins to
<i>sentimentalize</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e904src" href=

<p class="par">Contemporary German scholars, such as Wellhausen,
working on the synoptics, begin uneasily to note the lack of reality
and verisimilitude in the presentment there given, avowing a deficit of
biographical quality where English amateurs still heedlessly affirm a
veridical na&iuml;vet&eacute;. Wellhausen, tacitly clinging to the
biographical assumption, gives up section after section of Mark, where
our amateurs primitively acclaim as genuine biographic detail such an
item as &ldquo;asleep on the cushion&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd23e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:38">Mk. iv,
38</a>). Following another will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, Wellhausen is moved
to claim the episode of the widow&rsquo;s mite (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2021:1-4">Lk. xxi,
1&ndash;4</a>) as having biographical flavour, as if the admitted
inventor of other Lucan episodes could not have doctrinally framed
this. There is no <i>science</i> in such tentatives. They do but tell
of a search for a subjective basis of belief when criticism has
dissolved the objective bases of the old assumption.</p>
<p class="par">When it is pretended, as by Dr. Conybeare, that the
mythical theory rests on and grows solely out of the supernaturalist
details in the gospel story, the case is simply falsified. This writer
never seems to master his subject matter. Before Strauss, as by
Strauss, the myth-theory was widely applied to non-supernatural matter;
and to surmise a historical Jesus behind those details has been the
first step in all <span class="corr" id="xd23e923" title=
"Source: odern">modern</span> inquiry. The assertion that the rejection
of the historicity of Jesus &ldquo;is not really the final conclusion
of their [myth-theorists&rsquo;] researches, but an initial unproved
assumption&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e926src" href="#xd23e926"
name="xd23e926src">10</a> is categorically false. Professor
Smith&rsquo;s biographical statement negates it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e931src" href="#xd23e931" name="xd23e931src">11</a> As I have
repeatedly stated, I began without misgivings by assuming a historical
Jesus, and sought historically to trace him, regarding the birth myth
and the others as mere accretions. But the very first <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>step in
the strictly historical inquiry revealed difficulties which the
biographical school and the traditionalists alike had simply never
faced. The questions whether Jesus was &ldquo;of Nazareth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nazarene&rdquo; in that sense, or &ldquo;the Nazarite&rdquo;;
and why, if he was either of these, he was never so named in the
epistles, stood in the very front of the problem, wholly unregarded by
those who profess to trace a historical Jesus by historical method. The
problem of &ldquo;the twelve&rdquo; is to this day passed with equal
heedlessness by critics professing to work on historico-critical lines;
and the question of the authenticity of the teachings is no more
scientifically met. It was because at every step the effort to find
historical foundation failed utterly that after years of investigation
I sought and found in a thorough application of the myth-theory the
solution of the enigma. Invariably that gives light where the
historical assumption yields darkness.</p>
<p class="par">It is thoroughly characteristic of the spirit in which
some champions of the biographical view work that, in sequel to the
falsification of the problem just noted, we have from them the plea
that if we give up the historicity of Jesus, we must give up that of
Solon and Pythagoras; and that &ldquo;<i>obviously</i> Jesus has a far
larger <i>chance</i> to have really existed than Solon.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e946src" href="#xd23e946" name="xd23e946src">12</a>
Such a use of the conception of &ldquo;chance&rdquo; reveals the kind
of dialectic we are dealing with. One recalls Newman&rsquo;s derision
of the Paleyan position that the &ldquo;chances&rdquo; were in favour
of there being a God. &ldquo;If we deny all authenticity to
Jesus&rsquo;s teaching,&rdquo; we are asked, &ldquo;what of
Solon&rsquo;s traditional lore?&rdquo; Well, what of it? Is it to be
authenticated by the threat that it must go if we deny that the Sermon
on the Mount is a sermon at all? The fragments of Solon&rsquo;s verse
purport to have been written <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href=
"#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>by him: have we anything purporting
to have been written by Jesus? The very fact that we have only
fragments of Solon is in itself an argument in favour of their
genuineness: to Jesus any evangelist could ascribe any sayings at
will.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e954src" href="#xd23e954" name=
"xd23e954src">13</a></p>
<p class="par">As usual, the critic falsifies the debate, affirming
that &ldquo;<i>the</i> stories of Plutarch about him [Solon] are, <i>as
Grote says</i>, &lsquo;contradictory as well as
apocryphal.&rsquo;&rdquo; What Grote really says<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e972src" href="#xd23e972" name="xd23e972src">14</a> is that
Plutarch&rsquo;s stories &ldquo;<i>as to the way in which Salamis was
recovered</i> are contradictory as well as apocryphal.&rdquo; He makes
no such assertion as to the stories of Solon&rsquo;s life in general,
though, like every critical historian, he recognizes that many things
were ultimately ascribed to Solon which belong to later times.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e980src" href="#xd23e980" name="xd23e980src">15</a>
But the genuine fragments of Solon&rsquo;s verse and laws are sound
historical material. As Meyer claims,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e986src" href="#xd23e986" name="xd23e986src">16</a> the Archon
list is as valid as the Roman <i>Fasti</i>. It is precisely because of
the solid elements in the record that Solon stands as a historic
figure, while Lycurgus is given up as a deity Evemerized.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e994src" href="#xd23e994" name="xd23e994src">17</a>
On the principles of Dr. Conybeare, we must give up Solon because we
give up Lycurgus, or accept Lykurgos if we accept Solon. Historical
criticism does no such thing. It decides the cases on their merits by
critical tests, and finds the fact of a Solonian legislation
historically as certain as the Lycurgean is fabulous. The item that
Solon&rsquo;s family claimed to be descended from Poseidon is no ground
for doubting the historicity of Solon, because such claims were normal
in early Greece. Is it pretended that claims to be the Son of God were
normal in later Jewry?</p>
<p class="par">The device of saying that we must accept the historicity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>of Jesus if we accept that of Solon is merely a
new dressing of the old claim that we must believe in the resurrection
if we believe in the assassination of C&aelig;sar. Both theses rest on
spurious analogies; and both alike defeat themselves, the older by
carrying the implication that the prodigies at C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
death are as historical as the assassination; the newer by involving
the consequence that Solon accredits not only Lycurgus but Herakles and
Dionysos, Ulysses and Achilles.</p>
<p class="par">The argument from Pythagoras is a still more fatal
device. Of him &ldquo;it is no easy task to give an account that can
claim to be regarded as history.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1006src" href="#xd23e1006" name="xd23e1006src">18</a> And
&ldquo;of the opinions of Pythagoras we know even less than of his
life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1014src" href="#xd23e1014"
name="xd23e1014src">19</a> It is held to be certain that he taught the
doctrine of transmigration and originated certain propositions in
mathematics; but while the mathematical element has no analogue in the
gospels, the residual view of Pythagoras as vending in religion only a
&ldquo;thoroughly primitive&rdquo; set of taboos<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1019src" href="#xd23e1019" name="xd23e1019src">20</a> would
sanction, by analogy, the view that the real Jesus was the Talmudic Ben
Pandira, who dates about 100 B.C., and was reputed a worker of wonders
by sorcery. This is a sufficiently lame and impotent conclusion from a
polemic in favour of the gospel Jesus, whom it leaves, in effect, a
myth, as the myth-theory maintains. As for Apollonius of Tyana, one
holds him historical<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1024src" href=
"#xd23e1024" name="xd23e1024src">21</a> just because his myth-laden
story is finally intelligible as history, which is precisely what the
Jesus story is not.</p>
<p class="par">This said, <span class="sc">The Historical Jesus</span>
may be left, as it is, open to critical refutation. The present volume
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>theoretically constructive, and does not
unnecessarily return upon the other. It is open in its turn to
refutative criticism.</p>
<p class="par">That description, it may be remarked, would not be
accorded by me to a mere asseveration that there &ldquo;must&rdquo; be
a historical basis for the gospels in a <i>person</i> answering broadly
to the Gospel Jesus. Any one who confidently holds such a view need
hardly trouble himself with the present thesis at all: and for me any
one who affects to dispose of the issue by merely fulminating the
&ldquo;must&rdquo; is simply begging the question. Those who, on the
other hand, do but lean instinctively to such a belief may be
respectfully invited to reconsider it in the light of all hierology.
That there &ldquo;must&rdquo; be a historic process of causation behind
every cult is a truism: it does not in the least follow that the
historic basis must be the historicity of the God or Demigod round
whose name the cult centres.</p>
<p class="par">Many Saviour <span class="corr" id="xd23e1049" title=
"Source: na es">names</span> have been the centres of cults, in the
ancient world as in the modern. There were extensive and long-lived
worships of Herakles, Dionysos, Osiris, Attis, Adonis, in addition to
the age-long cults of the &ldquo;Supreme&rdquo; Gods. Is it claimed
that there &ldquo;must&rdquo; have been a historical Herakles, or
Dionysos, or Adonis? If so, is it further contended that there must
have been a historical Jehovah, a Jove, a Cybel&ecirc;, a Juno, a
Venus? If the Father-Gods and Mother-Gods could be evolved by
protracted mythop&oelig;ia, why not the Son-Gods?</p>
<p class="par">It is perfectly true, as was urged by the late Sir
Alfred Lyall, that in India and elsewhere distinguished men may to this
day be deified; that ancestor-worship played a great part in
God-making; and that tribal Gods are in many cases probably evolved
from distinguished chiefs. But such cases really defeat the inference
drawn from them. Such God-making can in no instance be shown
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>ever to have set up what can reasonably be termed
a world-religion. The world-religions are the product of a far more
protracted and complex causation. They grow from far further-reaching
roots. Above all, they have never grown up without the services either
of a numerous priesthood or of Sacred Books, or of both.</p>
<p class="par">Is it then contended that a Sacred Book must represent
the originative teaching of a real person and his disciples? It may or
may not; but what does not at all follow is that the personality
deified or extolled in the Sacred Book was real. Mohammed was a real
person: he made no claim to deity: he acclaimed an established God. The
names of Zoroaster and Buddha were probably not those of real persons:
the first figures as a cult-building priest; the second as a Teacher,
enshrined from the first in a luxuriant myth, whence his practical
deification. In both cases the specific centre of the religion is the
Book or Books; and it is beyond question that in both cases many hands
wrought on these. To say that only a primary personality of abnormal
greatness could have inspired the writing of the books is really
equivalent to saying that there must have been a historical Jehovah to
account for the Old Testament, and a historical Allah to account for
the Koran. Let it be freely granted that the <i>writers</i> of Sacred
Books were in many cases remarkable personalities. That is a totally
different proposition from the one we are considering.</p>
<p class="par">The claim that the gospels <i>could</i> only have
originated round the memory of an inspiring and love-creating
personality is in effect an evasion of the multitudinous facts of
hierology. The European who sees nothing in the fact that the mythic
Krishna is loved by millions of Hindoos; that in ages of antiquity
millions of worshippers were absorbed in the love of Dionysos,
mutilated themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>for Attis, and wept for Adonis, is not really
ready for a verdict on what &ldquo;must&rdquo; have been as regards the
building up of any cult. Are the Psalms, once more, a testimony to the
historicity of Jehovah, or is the hymn of Hippolytos to Artemis, in
Euripides, a proof of anything but that men can love an
imagination?</p>
<p class="par">The special claim for a historical Jesus arises out of
the very fact that Jesus alone among the Saviour Gods of antiquity
(Buddha being excluded from that category) <i>is</i> celebrated in a
set of Sacred Books in which he figures as at once a Sacrificed God and
a Teaching God.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1073src" href="#xd23e1073"
name="xd23e1073src">22</a> But the worships of the Saviours Dionysos
and Herakles and Adonis, <i>without</i> Sacred Books (apart from temple
liturgies), were as confident as the worship of Jesus. Is the
production of Sacred Books in itself any more of a testimony to a
Saviour God&rsquo;s human actuality than the worship with which they
are associated?</p>
<p class="par">Historically speaking, the emergence of Sacred Books as
accompaniments of a popular cultus is a result of special culture
conditions. In the case of Judaism these have never been scientifically
traced, by reason of the presuppositions of the past.<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e1081src" href="#xd23e1081" name="xd23e1081src">23</a> But we
can trace later cases. Early Christism founded primarily on the Sacred
Books of Judaism; and it <i>needed</i> to produce books of its own if
it was to survive as against the overshadowing parent cult. Save for
these books, Christism would have disappeared as did Mithraism, of
which the scanty hieratic literature remained occult, liturgical,
unpopular, where Christism was committed to publicity by the Jewish
lead. To make of Sacred Books produced under those special conditions a
special argument for the historicity of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>contents, or of their narrative groundwork, is to
embrace the fallacy of the single instance. And when the contents
utterly fail to sustain the tests of rational documentary criticism, to
fall back on a &ldquo;must&rdquo; for certification of the actuality of
the figure they deify is merely to renounce critical reason.</p>
<p class="par">The rational problem is to account historically for the
projection as a whole, to explain the main features and as many minor
details as may be, as we explain the &ldquo;personality&rdquo; and the
myth of Herakles or Samson or Adonis, the doctrines and fictions of the
Books of Ruth and Esther, the religions of Krishna and Mithra and
Quetzalcoatl. We are now compendiously to make the attempt.</p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy has declared<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1099src" href="#xd23e1099" name="xd23e1099src">24</a> that
&ldquo;One can explain to oneself Jesus: one cannot explain to oneself
those who invented him.&rdquo; In the previous volume it has been
contended that M. Loisy has decisively failed to &ldquo;explain
Jesus&rdquo; as a possible person: in this we essay to explain
&ldquo;those who invented him.&rdquo; M. Loisy is an illustrious
New-Testament scholar: he is not a mythologist or a comparative
hierologist. It is very likely that he would find it difficult to
explain to himself those who invented Tezcatlipoca; but it would hardly
follow that Tezcatlipoca was not invented. In point of fact, a large
portion of M. Loisy&rsquo;s own important critical performance consists
precisely in explaining away as <i>inventions</i> a multitude of items
in the gospel narrative. He can understand invention of many parts, and
admits that unless removed they make an incongruous whole. There is
really no more difficulty in explaining the other parts as similar
inventions than in explaining these. Thus the alleged difficulty is
illusory. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The occupation of &ldquo;explaining to oneself&rdquo;
imaginary beings has been the occupation of theologians through whole
millenniums. There can still be found even a hierologist or two who
believe in the historicity of Krishna; as the judicious Mosheim in the
eighteenth century confidently believed in the historicity of Mercury
and Mithra. Those&mdash;and they are many&mdash;who are now content to
see myth in the figures of Mithra and Krishna, with or without the
nimbus of Sacred Books, may on that score consent to consider the
thesis of this volume.</p>
<p class="par">It will be no adequate answer to that to say, as will
doubtless be said, that the outline of the evolution of the myth is
unsatisfying. In the very nature of the case, the connections of the
data must be speculative. It may well be that those here
attempted&mdash;some of them modifications of previous
theories&mdash;will have to be at various points reshaped; and I invite
the reader to weigh carefully the views of Professors Drews and Smith
where I diverge from them. The complete establishment of a historical
construction will be a long and difficult task. But in its least
satisfying aspect the myth-theory is a scientific substitution for what
is wholly <i>dis</i>satisfying&mdash;the entirely unhistorical
construction furnished by the gospels.</p>
<p class="par">That has been under revision for a hundred and fifty
years, with an outlay of labour that is appalling to think of, in view
of the utter futility of the search&mdash;or, let us say, the labour in
proportion to the result, for toil even upon false clues has yielded
some knowledge that avails for rectification. But the labour has meant
a steadily dwindling confidence in a dwindling residuum of supposed
fact; though every shortening of the line of defence has evoked furious
outcry from the unthinking faithful. The first pious framers of
&ldquo;harmonies&rdquo; of the gospels <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>were indignantly told by
the more stupid pious that there was no strife to harmonize: the
Schmiedels and Loisys of to-day, striving their hardest to save
something by rational methods from the rational advance, are execrated
by those who believe more than they. The more instructed believers are
as warm in their resentment of the latest and coolest negative
criticism as were their fathers towards the contemptuous exposure of
the contradictions of &ldquo;inspiration.&rdquo; Anger, it would seem,
always leaps to the help of shaken confidence. Let the believer
perpend.</p>
<p class="par">It is not orthodoxy that is to-day fighting the case of
the historicity of Jesus. Orthodoxy is committed to the miraculous, to
Revelation, to the Incarnation, the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection,
and, if it would be consistent, to the Ascension, which is on the same
plane of belief. Upon such assumptions, there can be no critical
defence worthy of the name. The defence is being conducted mainly by
the avowed or non-avowed Neo-Unitarians of the various churches and
countries; and these are simply standing either at the position taken
up fifty years ago by Renan, whose &ldquo;biography&rdquo; of Jesus was
received with a far more widespread and no less violent storm of
censure than that now being turned upon the myth-theory; or at the more
nearly negative position of Strauss, which was still more fiercely
censured. Renan&rsquo;s position, or Strauss&rsquo;s, is now the
position of the mass of &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; scholars and students.
Those who have thus seen a denounced heresy become the standpoint of
ordinary scholarly belief should be slow to conclude that a newer
heresy will not in time find similar acceptance. <span class=

Conflict</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">For the purposes of this inquiry, all miracles,
strictly so-called, are out of discussion. This does not mean that the
myth-theory of Jesus is an outcome of atheistic philosophy. One of the
most brilliant of modern books on Jesus is the work of an avowed
atheist,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1138src" href="#xd23e1138" name=
"xd23e1138src">1</a> who accepted substantially the whole of the
non-supernatural presentment of Jesus in the gospels, taking it to be a
bad biography, and subjecting the doctrine to keen but sympathetic
criticism. This writer, dismissing miracles as outside debate, had a
conviction of the historicity of Jesus which was in no way affected by
a knowledge of modern documentary criticism. On the other hand,
Professor Arthur Drews, author of <span class="sc">The Christ
Myth</span>, expressly claims to urge the myth-theory in the interest
of theistic religion. Of course he too dismisses miracles as outside
discussion.</p>
<p class="par">Those who are still concerned to discuss them, and to
affirm such beliefs as those of the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection,
should turn their attention to the well-known work of the late W. R.
Cassels, <span class="sc">Supernatural Religion</span>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1151src" href="#xd23e1151" name="xd23e1151src">2</a>
in which the whole supernaturalist case, in its double aspect of
&ldquo;revelation&rdquo; and miracles, is examined with an abundance of
learning, patience, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>and candour. Disparaged in its day by
professional orthodox scholars, that treatise has so completely done
its special work in the general criticism of supernaturalist faith
that, however common orthodoxy may still be, the matter is now little
debated among instructed men. Those who still hold the orthodox
position, therefore, are not here addressed. Our inquiry invites the
attention only of those who, abandoning the supernaturalist basis of
the Christian creed, seek to retain (it may be as the ground for a
transformed &ldquo;Christianity&rdquo;) (1) the human personality which
they believe to have underlain the admitted myths of the record, and
(2) the teachings&mdash;or some of them&mdash;ascribed to the God-Man
of the Gospels. The problem is one of historical criticism, and does
not turn upon theism or atheism. The historicity of Jesus is maintained
not only by &ldquo;Christians&rdquo; of various degrees of heterodoxy
but by some professed rationalists; by critics eminent for judicial
temper, as by Professor Schmiedel of Z&uuml;rich; and on the other hand
by Dr. F. C. Conybeare.</p>
<p class="par">These critics agree in regarding Jesus as a natural man,
naturally born, and it is to them that we must reply. When an orthodox
Christian like the Rev. Dr. T. J. Thorburn, holding by the Annunciation
and the Virgin Birth, sets himself to rebut the myth-theory<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1158src" href="#xd23e1158" name="xd23e1158src">3</a>
by scouting myth analogies, it would be idle to argue with him. A
writer who can believe he has evidence for a story of human
parthenogenesis has no conception of evidence in common with us. It is
accordingly needless to point out that he constantly and absurdly
misunderstands the myth argument;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1163src"
href="#xd23e1163" name="xd23e1163src">4</a> that he discusses
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>Evemerism without knowing what it means;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1170src" href="#xd23e1170" name="xd23e1170src">5</a>
and that he merely juggles with such cruces as the stories of the
Transfiguration and the Ascension. From one at his standpoint we can
expect nothing else; and to those whom his exposition satisfies no
myth-theory can appeal. When he resorts to the device of denying
&ldquo;spiritual insight&rdquo; to those who accept scientific tests,
he merely exemplifies the normal procedure of orthodox incompetence.
The religious reasoner who flouts reason usually certificates and
betrays himself in that inexpensive fashion. Our argument is addressed
to those who profess to apply to Biblical matters the principles of
historical criticism.</p>
<p class="par">The biographical school, as one may inoffensively term
the variously minded champions of the historicity of the record,
abandon the Virgin Birth and the Resurrection as impossibilities. That
is to say, they <i>accept</i> the myth-theory as regards those two
cardinal items of the Christian legend. They also in general recognize
that the fourth gospel, in so far as it differs vitally from the
synoptics, is in the main a process of myth-making. But, clinging to
the alleged substratum, most members of the school adhere to the
fundamental historicity of the Crucifixion. Here they stand with
Strauss, who found in the execution of Jesus by Pontius Pilate a solid
historical fact. Strauss is generally explicit as to his reasons for
accepting and rejecting; and while he resolves into myth at least
nine-tenths of the gospel narratives, finding them mere inventions to
&ldquo;fulfil&rdquo; supposed Old Testament predictions, he finds the
testimony of Tacitus unquestionable as to the execution.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1178src" href="#xd23e1178" name=
"xd23e1178src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">Now, the <span class="sc">Annals</span> of Tacitus is
itself a questioned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span>document; but even if we take it as
unquestionable it is admittedly only a late statement of a narrative
already made current by the Christists, the <span class=
"sc">Annals</span> being commonly dated about 120 <span class=
"sc">C.E.</span> Either Tacitus was founding on a Roman record of the
Crucifixion or he was merely saying what Christists said as to the
origin of their sect. If the latter, he supplies no historical basis.
On the other hand, the unlikelihood of there being a Roman record of
executions in Palestine ninety years before is so great that no
Christian advocate now appears to affirm it. Tacitus in fact gives no
sign of consulting official records,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1200src" href="#xd23e1200" name="xd23e1200src">7</a> his only
traceable sources being previous historians, notably Suetonius. Thus
Strauss&rsquo;s express ground for accepting the execution of a
&ldquo;Christ&rdquo; by Pontius Pilate is really illusory; and when we
further find him pronouncing that the Barabbas episode must be held
fundamentally historical because it is &ldquo;so firmly rooted in the
early Christian tradition,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1207src"
href="#xd23e1207" name="xd23e1207src">8</a> we are again compelled to
reject his test. As we shall see, the Barabbas episode is
unintelligible as history, but highly intelligible as myth. At the very
outset, then, unverified assumptions are seen to be made by the
biographical school as to what may confidently be taken as historical,
even when, as in the case of Strauss, they affirm an abundance of
myth.</p>
<p class="par">Where Strauss was rash, later rationalistic writers have
been more so. My old friend, the English translator of Jules
Soury&rsquo;s early work on Jesus, took for granted that behind
legendary heroes in general there is always a nucleus of fact; but
Soury, after postulating a large part of the gospel story as veridical,
gave up a number of his own items.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1212src"
href="#xd23e1212" name="xd23e1212src">9</a> As soon as he began to
apply <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>criticism, they were seen to be arbitrary
assumptions. Equally arbitrary is the assumption of &ldquo;some
basis,&rdquo; made upon no scientific principle.</p>
<p class="par">The biographical school in general adhere at least to
the trial and condemnation before Pilate, though many abandon as
fiction the trial before the Sanhedrim, which indeed was abandoned as
long ago as the third gospel, in favour of an equally fictitious trial
before Herod. As is seen by M. Loisy, the trial before Pilate is for
the historical critic the keystone of the tragedy story. If that goes,
there remains only a highly composite body of teaching, with no
identifiable historical personality to which to attach it.</p>
<p class="par">But even as regards the trials there is wide divergence
among the biographical school. For instance, Mr. Charles Stanley
Lester, an ex-clergyman of Milwaukee, in his interesting work
<span class="sc">The Historic Jesus</span>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1226src" href="#xd23e1226" name="xd23e1226src">10</a> entirely
rejects the Sanhedrim trial, and likewise the gospel account of the
Pilate trial, but finds &ldquo;probable history&rdquo; in the view that
the priests privately persuaded Pilate to condemn Jesus on their
accusation without any trial.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1232src" href=
"#xd23e1232" name="xd23e1232src">11</a> Again, the anonymous author of
<span class="sc">The Four Gospels as Historical
Records</span>,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1238src" href="#xd23e1238"
name="xd23e1238src">12</a> an eminently keen, searching, and candid
critic, rejects alike the Judas story, the trial before the Sanhedrim,
and the trial before Pilate,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1242src" href=
"#xd23e1242" name="xd23e1242src">13</a> as he does most of the other
items of the gospel history, yet throughout seems to take for granted
the historicity of the &ldquo;Great Teacher,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; never even raising that issue save in protesting
that he has absolutely nothing to say against him.<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e1245src" href="#xd23e1245" name="xd23e1245src">14</a> So
completely does he destroy the whole narrative, indeed, that he can
hardly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>be said to maintain the thesis of historicity, but
he never calls it in question: he merely destroys the biography. Mr.
Lester, on the other hand, confidently rejects a hundred details as
myth, claiming that he presents the gospels &ldquo;relieved of the
drapery of mythology and set free from all dogmatic
fictions&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1252src" href="#xd23e1252"
name="xd23e1252src">15</a> and yet no less confidently affirms a
hundred &ldquo;undoubted&rdquo; things, in a manner that almost outgoes
M. Loisy.</p>
<p class="par">If, faced by such procedures, the critical reader asks
upon what grounds the historical personality is accepted, he gets from
the able anonymous writer no answer, and from Mr. Lester, in effect,
only the answer that the teachings which appeal to him in the gospels
are self-certified as coming from the &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; in whom he
believes, while the others are dismissed by him as inconsistent with
his conception. As a rule, the negative criticism is soundly reasoned;
the constructive is purely arbitrary. Yet Mr. Lester is an amiable
and&mdash;apart from his quaint animosity towards &ldquo;the Semitic
mind&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1259src" href="#xd23e1259" name=
"xd23e1259src">16</a>&mdash;a temperate critic, warmly concerned for
historic truth and loyally opposed to all kinds of priestcraft, ancient
and modern. What we must ask from such critics is that they should
bring to bear on their biographical assumption the same critical method
that they bring to bear on the multitude of details which strike them
as obviously unhistorical. Rejecting miracles and self-contradictory
narrative, they affirm a miraculous and self-contradictory Person. That
conception too must be analysed.</p>
<p class="par">The Jesus of the Gospels is at once a Messiah (with no
definite mission as such), a Saviour God with whom <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>the
indefinite Messiah coalesces, and a Teaching God who coalesces with
both. The biographical school, in the mass, posit a human Teacher,
round whose teaching a Messianic conception combined with a doctrine of
salvation by blood sacrifice has nucleated. If in this tissue there
cannot be inserted the historical detail of the trial before Pilate,
there is nothing left but the quasi-mythical detail of the crucifixion
as an ostensible historical basis for the Messianic and other teaching,
so much of which is alien to the early cult, so much of which is
critically to be assigned to previous and contemporary Jewish sources,
and so much to later Jesuist editors and compilers. Those laymen who
are content to pick out of the gospels certain teachings, such as the
Sermon on the Mount, and call these &ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; have
not realized how completely documentary analysis has disintegrated the
teachings into pre-Jesuine Jewish and post-Jesuine Gentile matter. The
latest professional analysis, as we have seen, leaves no Jesuine
&ldquo;Teaching&rdquo; save an eschatology, a doctrine of &ldquo;last
things,&rdquo; coming from a visionary Messiah with no political or
social message.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1266src" href="#xd23e1266"
name="xd23e1266src">17</a> The bulk of the biographical school, on the
other hand, cling diversely to &ldquo;something&rdquo; in the Teaching
which shall be somehow commensurate with the &ldquo;impression&rdquo;
made by the life and death of the Teacher, which, from Renan onwards,
they regard as the real genesis of the myth of the Resurrection and the
consequent cult.</p>
<p class="par">Having shown, then, the cogent critical reasons for
dismissing the entire record of the triple episode of the Supper, the
Agony, and the Trials, as unhistorical,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1274src" href="#xd23e1274" name="xd23e1274src">18</a> it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>concerns us to show (1) that the whole is
intelligible only as myth, and (2) how the myth probably arose. The
sequence culminates in the Crucifixion, which, with the Sacrament, is
for the rational hierologist as for the orthodox theologian the centre
of Christianity. Equally the biographical school are committed to
maintaining the historicity of the event, without which they cannot
explain the rise of the cult. If then the myth-theory is to stand, it
must show that the central narrative belongs to the realm of myth.</p>

Gentiles.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1293src" href="#xd23e1293"
name="xd23e1293src">19</a> Thus the term &ldquo;Eucharist,&rdquo; which
means &ldquo;thanksgiving&rdquo; or &ldquo;thank-offering,&rdquo;
applied in the <span class="sc">Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</span>
to the kind of sacrament there indicated, and thence taken by Justin
and other Fathers, is clearly a misnomer for the thing specified in the
gospels. Of the gospel sacrifice, the sacrament is the liturgical and
symbolic application.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1302src" href=
"#xd23e1302" name="xd23e1302src">20</a> Or, otherwise, the crucifixion
is the fulfilment of the theory of the sacrament. On the view of the
historicity of the former, or of both, it would be necessary to show
why the procedure set forth in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>gospels so closely simulated a
human sacrifice; and this is incidentally attempted in passing by M.
Loisy. The scene of derision by the soldiers, he says, &ldquo;was
perhaps connected with some pagan festival usage.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1313src" href="#xd23e1313" name=
"xd23e1313src">21</a> But this at once admits the entrance of the
myth-theory, which affirms that an immemorial &ldquo;festival&rdquo;
usage is indicated. If Jesus was executed to please the Jewish
multitude, as is the view even of the most destructive of the later
German exegetes<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1319src" href="#xd23e1319"
name="xd23e1319src">22</a>&mdash;why should the execution take a pagan
form? M. Loisy, who had previously accepted as history the narrative of
the Entry into Jerusalem, with the public acclamation of Jesus as
&ldquo;the Son of David,&rdquo; is unprepared to believe with the
German critic that within a week the multitude cried &ldquo;Crucify
him!&rdquo;; and he therefore wholly eliminates that item from his
biographical sketch. He implies, however, that the doom of Jesus was
passed by Pilate to please the priests, which is equally fatal to the
thesis of a pagan festival usage. He accepts, further, the scene of the
Mocking, with no ostensible critical reason, but presumably in order to
establish a history which would explain the subsequent growth of the
cult. In this process the salient episode of Barabbas is dismissed by
him as unhistorical.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1324src" href=
"#xd23e1324" name="xd23e1324src">23</a></p>
<p class="par">Thus the most distinguished critic of the biographical
school has no account to give of a second salient item in the record
which, being entirely non-supernatural, must be held to have been
inserted for some strong reason. It in fact closely involves the whole
myth-theory. Barabbas was in all probability a regular figure in
Semitic popular religion; and the name connects documentarily with that
of Jesus. The reading &ldquo;Jesus <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>Barabbas,&rdquo; in <a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=

"#xd23e1334" name="xd23e1334src">24</a> was long the accepted one in
the ancient Church; and its entrance and its disappearance are alike
significant. It is obviously probable that such a name as &ldquo;Jesus
the Son of the Father&rdquo; (= Bar-Abbas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1349src" href="#xd23e1349" name="xd23e1349src">25</a>), applied

name="xd23e1352src">26</a> But on that view there is no explanation of
its entrance. Such a stumbling-block could not have been set up without
a compulsive reason.</p>
<p class="par">The anthropological and hierological data go to show
that an annual sacrifice of a &ldquo;Son of the Father&rdquo; was a
long-standing feature in the Semitic world. A story in Philo
Jud&aelig;us about a mummery in Alexandria in ridicule of the Jewish
King Agrippa, the grandson of Herod, points pretty clearly to a local
Jewish survival from that usage. A lunatic named Karabas is said to
have been paraded as a mock-king, with mock-crown, sceptre and
robe.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1357src" href="#xd23e1357" name=
"xd23e1357src">27</a> In all likelihood the <i>K</i> is a
mistranscription for <i>B</i>. In any case, &ldquo;the custom of
sacrificing the son for the father was common, if not universal, among
Semitic peoples,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1371src" href=
"#xd23e1371" name="xd23e1371src">28</a> as among others; and the
Passover<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1376src" href="#xd23e1376" name=
"xd23e1376src">29</a> was originally a sacrifice of firstlings, human
and animal,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1385src" href="#xd23e1385" name=
"xd23e1385src">30</a> the former being probably most prevalent in times
of disaster. &ldquo;Devotion&rdquo; was the principle: surrogate
sacrifices would normally be substituted. Sacrifice of a king&rsquo;s
son, in particular, was held to be of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>overwhelming efficacy by
early Hebrews and other Semites, as among other races in the savage and
barbaric stages.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1400src" href="#xd23e1400"
name="xd23e1400src">31</a></p>
<p class="par">There is nothing peculiar to the Semites either in the
general or in the particular usage, both being once nearly universal;
but it is with the Semites that we are here specially concerned. The
story of Abraham and Isaac, to say nothing of that of Jephthah&rsquo;s
daughter, is a finger-post in the evolution of religion, being
inferribly a humane myth to promote the substitution of animal for
human sacrifice. And the Ph&oelig;nician myth of &ldquo;Ieoud,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;only-begotten&rdquo; son of King Kronos, &ldquo;whom the
Ph&oelig;nicians call Israel,&rdquo; sacrificed by his father at a time
of national danger, after being dressed in the trappings of
royalty,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1413src" href="#xd23e1413" name=
"xd23e1413src">32</a> points towards the historic roots of
Christianity. Again and again we meet the conception of the
&ldquo;only-begotten&rdquo; &ldquo;Son of the
Father&rdquo;&mdash;Father Abraham, Father Kronos, Father Israel, the
Father-King&mdash;as a special sacrifice in Hebrew and other Semitic
history. Kronos is a Semitic God; and in connection with the Roman
Saturnalia we have the record of a Greek oracle commanding to
&ldquo;send a man to the Father&rdquo;&mdash;that is, to
Kronos.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1421src" href="#xd23e1421" name=
"xd23e1421src">33</a></p>
<p class="par">What is certain is that sacrifices of kings, which were
at one stage of social evolution normal,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1432src" href="#xd23e1432" name="xd23e1432src">34</a> inevitably
tended to take other tribal or communal forms; and a multitude of rites
preserved plain marks of the regal origin. Kings would inevitably pass
off their original tragic burden; the community, bent on the safeguard
of sacrifice, shifted it in turn.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1445src"
href="#xd23e1445" name="xd23e1445src">35</a> Sacrifice of some kind, it
was felt, there must <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35"

id="xd23e1453src" href="#xd23e1453" name="xd23e1453src">36</a> that
conviction lies at the base of the Christian as of the Jewish religion:
it is fundamental to all primitive religion; and it is happily beyond
our power to realize save symbolically the immeasurable human slaughter
that the religious conviction has involved.</p>
<p class="par">Primarily, voluntary victims were desired; and in Roman
and Japanese history there are special or general records of their
being forthcoming, annually or in times of emergency.<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e1464src" href="#xd23e1464" name="xd23e1464src">37</a> Even in
the case of animal sacrifice, the Romans had a trick of putting barley
in the victim&rsquo;s ear to make him bow his head as if in
submission.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1473src" href="#xd23e1473" name=
"xd23e1473src">38</a> But as regards human sacrifices, which were felt
to be specially efficacious, the progression was inevitable from
willing to compelled victims; and out of the multitude of the forms of
human sacrifice, for which war captives and slaves at some stages
supplied a large proportion of the victims, we single that of the
evolution from the voluntary scape-goat or the sacrificed king or
messenger, through the victim &ldquo;bought with a price,&rdquo; to the
released criminal or other desperate or resigned person bribed with a
period of licence and abundance to die for the community at the end of
it.</p>
<p class="par">In many if not in most of these cases, deification of
the victim was involved in the theory, the victim being customarily
identified with the God.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1484src" href=
"#xd23e1484" name="xd23e1484src">39</a> It was so in certain special
sacrifices in pre-Christian Mexico.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1493src"
href="#xd23e1493" name="xd23e1493src">40</a> It was so in the human
sacrifices of the Khonds of Orissa, which subsisted till about the
middle of last century.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1498src" href=
"#xd23e1498" name="xd23e1498src">41</a> In the latter instance, of
which we have precise record, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>the annual victims were taken from
families devoted by purchase to the function, or were bought as
children and brought up for the purpose. They were &ldquo;bought with a
price.&rdquo; When definitely allotted, the males were permitted
absolute sexual liberty, being regarded as already virtually deified.
The victim was finally slain &ldquo;for the sins of the world,&rdquo;
and was liturgically declared a God in the process.</p>
<p class="par">Such rites gradually dwindled in progressive communities
from ritual murders into ritual mysteries or masquerades; even as human
sacrifices in general, in most parts of the world, dwindled from bodies
to parts of bodies, fingers, hair, foreskins; from human to animal
victims;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1509src" href="#xd23e1509" name=
"xd23e1509src">42</a> from larger to smaller animals; from these to
fowls; from real animals to baked or clay models, fruits, grains,
sheafs of rushes, figures, paper or other symbols. It seems usually to
have been humane kings or chiefs who imposed the improvement on
priesthoods. And as with the victim, so with the sacramental meal which
accompanied so many sacrifices. Cannibal sacraments were once,
probably, universal: they have survived down till recent times in
certain regions; but with advance in civilization they early and
inevitably tend to become merely symbolic. In Mexico at the advent of
Cortes, both the cannibal and the symbolic forms subsisted&mdash;the
former under conventional limitations; the latter in the practice of
eating a baked image which had been raised on a cross and there
pierced, for sanctification.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1527src" href=
"#xd23e1527" name="xd23e1527src">43</a> This &ldquo;Eating of the
God&rdquo; was very definitely a sacrament; but so were the
cannibalistic sacraments which preceded it. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Surveying the general evolution, we reach the inference
that somewhere in Asia Minor there subsisted before &ldquo;our
era&rdquo; a cult or cults in which a &ldquo;Son of the Father&rdquo;
was annually sacrificed under one or other of the categories of human
sacrifice&mdash;Scapegoat, representative Firstling, Vegetation God, or
Messenger; possibly in some cases under all four aspects in one. The
usage may or may not have subsisted in post-exilic Jerusalem: quite
possibly it did, for not only do the Sacred Books avow constant popular
and legal resort to &ldquo;heathen&rdquo; practices of human
sacrifice,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1535src" href="#xd23e1535" name=
"xd23e1535src">44</a> but Jewish religious lore preserves in a variety
of forms clear evidence of institutions of human sacrifice which are
not recognized in the Sacred Books.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1544src"
href="#xd23e1544" name="xd23e1544src">45</a> In any case, in connection
with the particular cult or rite in question there subsisted also a
Eucharist or Sacrament or Holy Supper, analogous to the sacraments of
the cults of Mithra, Dionysos, Attis, and many other Gods.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1558src" href="#xd23e1558" name=
"xd23e1558src">46</a> At a remote period it had been strictly
cannibalistic: in course of time, it became symbolical. In other words,
originally the sacrificed victim was sacramentally eaten; in course of
time the thing eaten was something else, with at most a ritual formula
of &ldquo;body and blood.&rdquo; At a certain stage, whether by regal
or other compulsion or by choice of the devotees, the annual rite of
sacrifice became a mere ritual or Mystery Drama&mdash;as in other cases
it became a public masquerade. The former evolution underlay the
religions of Dionysos, Osiris, Adonis, and Attis: <i>the latter may or
may not have gone on alongside of the former</i>.</p>
<p class="par">What does emerge from the gospel narrative concerning
Barabbas and Jesus is, not that such an episode <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>happened: here the myth-theory is at one with M.
Loisy, who in effect pronounces the narrative to be myth: but that in
the first age of Christianity the <i>name</i> &ldquo;Jesus
Barabbas&rdquo; was well known, and stood for something well known. It
was certainly known to the Jews, for we have Talmudical mention, dating
from a period just after the fall of the Temple, that there was a
Jewish ritual &ldquo;Week of the Son, or, as some call it, <i>Jesus the
Son</i>,&rdquo; in connection with the circumcision and redemption of
the first-born child.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1579src" href=
"#xd23e1579" name="xd23e1579src">47</a> From the inference of the
currency of the name there is no escape: attached to a robber and
murderer it could never have got into the gospels otherwise. And the
myth-theory can supply the explanation which neither the orthodox nor
the biographical theory can yield. We have outside evidence that a
sacrifice of a &ldquo;Son of the Father&rdquo; was customary in parts
of the Semitic world. What the gospel story <i>proves</i> is that it
was known to have been a <i>practice</i>, either at Jerusalem or
elsewhere, to release a prisoner to the multitude in connection with a
popular festival, which might or might not have been the Passover. The
release may have been for the purpose either of a religious masquerade
or of a sacrifice. Either way, the religious rite involved was a rite
of &ldquo;Jesus Barabbas&rdquo;&mdash;Jesus the Son of the
Father&mdash;and it involved either a real or a mock sacrifice, in
which the &ldquo;Son&rdquo; figured as a mock king, with robe and
crown.</p>
<p class="par">The more the problem is considered, then, the more clear
becomes the solution. As soon as the Jesuist cult reached the stage of
propaganda in which it described its Son-God as having died, in
circumstances of ignominy, as an atoning sacrifice, it would be met by
the memory <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>of the actual Barabbas rite. Given that the
Barabbas victim was ritually scourged and &ldquo;crucified&rdquo; (a
term which has yet to be investigated), it follows that wherever the
early propaganda<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1599src" href="#xd23e1599"
name="xd23e1599src">48</a> went in areas in which the memory of the
rite subsisted, the Christists would be told that their Jesus the Son
was simply the Jesus Barabbas of that popular rite; and the only
possible&mdash;or at least the best&mdash;way to override the
impeachment was to insert a narrative which reduced the regular ritual
Jesus Barabbas to a single person, a criminal whom the wicked Jewish
multitude had chosen to save instead of the sinless Jesus of the cult.
In the circumstances given it was an absolutely necessary invention;
and no other circumstances could conceivably have made it necessary.
The story, by the unwilling admission of M. Loisy, who conserves
whatever he thinks he critically can of the record, is a myth; and it
is a myth which on the biographical theory cannot be explained. The
myth-theory has explained it. As for the disappearance of the
&ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; from the name of Barabbas in the records, it hardly
needs explanation. When the memory of the old annual rite died away
from general knowledge, the elision of the &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; would be
desirable alike for the learned who still knew and the unlearned who
did not.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1602src" href="#xd23e1602" name=

<p class="par first">It is needless for the defender of the
biographical theory to interject a protest that the Barabbas story is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>only one item in the case. The other items will
all be dealt with in turn: that has been put in the front because of
its crucial significance. Incidentally it may be further noted that the
myth-theory explains the plainly unhistorical item of &ldquo;the thirty
pieces of silver,&rdquo; confusedly explained from &ldquo;the prophet
Jeremy&rdquo; as &ldquo;the price of him that was priced, whom
[certain] of the children of Israel did price&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:9">Mt. xxvii,

<p class="par">The story of the Betrayal is fiction on the very face of
the narrative, Judas being employed to point out a personage of
declared notoriety, about whose movements there had been no
secrecy.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1630src" href="#xd23e1630" name=
"xd23e1630src">50</a> Judas is demonstrably a somewhat late figure in
the gospel legend, coming from the later Mystery Drama, not from the
rite on which it was built. But, whatever may be the solution of the
cryptogram about the potter&rsquo;s field and the thirty pieces of
silver in Zechariah, or the historic fact about Aceldama, one thing is
clear: &ldquo;the price of him that was priced,&rdquo; in Matthew,
tells of the usage of paying a price for sacrificial victims.</p>
<p class="par">It does not follow that a price was regularly paid in
the case of the Jesus Barabbas rite, though the record actually insists
on the item by way of the Judas story: what is clear is that a memory
of bought victims subsisted after the fall of Jerusalem. It is not
unlikely that &ldquo;Aceldama&rdquo; was a field where sacrificial
victims were either slain or buried, or both. A passage in the Kalika
Purana suggests the procedure, and the probable significance of
Golgotha, the &ldquo;place of skulls.&rdquo; In the Hindu rite, the
human victim was immolated &ldquo;at a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>cemetery or holy
place,&rdquo; upon which the sacrificer was not to look; and the head
was presented in &ldquo;<i>the place of skulls</i>, sacred to
Bhoiruvu&rdquo; (God of Fear). This could be in a special temple, or in
a part of the cemetery, &ldquo;or on a mountain.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1642src" href="#xd23e1642" name=
"xd23e1642src">51</a></p>
<p class="par">At this point a warning must be given against the
confusion set up by the habitual assumption that &ldquo;something of
the kind&rdquo; occurred under Pontius Pilate. It is only on the
biographical theory that that date is valid. Pontius Pilate is simply a
figure in the later Mystery Drama, originally chosen, probably, because
of his notoriety as a shedder of Jewish blood.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1650src" href="#xd23e1650" name="xd23e1650src">52</a> We are not
bound to prove that at his date the usage of ritual human sacrifice,
real or pretended, survived at Jerusalem, though it may have done, as
it survived at Rhodes in the time of Porphyry in the form, perhaps, of
a Semitic mystery drama.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1662src" href=
"#xd23e1662" name="xd23e1662src">53</a></p>
<p class="par">It is the assumption of the historicity of the
Crucifixion that partly disarms the theorem of Sir J. G. Frazer as to a
coincidence of Jewish sacrificial rites.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1669src" href="#xd23e1669" name="xd23e1669src">54</a> Noting that
the details of the Crucifixion closely conform to those of a human
sacrifice sometimes practised in the Christian era in connection with
the Roman Saturnalia, and also to those of a real or mock rite
connected with the Babylonian feast of the Sac&aelig;a, he resorts to
the alternative hypotheses (<i>a</i>) that the analogous Jewish feast
of Purim, imported from Babylon after the Return, and also involving
either a real or a mock crucifixion, <i>chanced to coincide with the
actual crucifixion</i> of the gospel Jesus; or that (<i>b</i>)
Christian tradition &ldquo;shifted the date of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>crucifixion by a month or so&rdquo; to connect it
with the Passover. As the official Purim rite, though cognate with that
of the Passover, cannot well have been allowed to coincide with it, the
theory of coincidence is barred; and the theorist is assured by an
expert colleague that &ldquo;all that we hear of the Passion is only
explicable by the Passover festival,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;without the
background of the festival all that we know of the Crucifixion and of
what led up to it is totally unintelligible.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e1688src" href="#xd23e1688" name="xd23e1688src">55</a></p>
<p class="par">When, however, the unhistorical character of the gospel
narrative is realized, such difficulties disappear. The
<i>intention</i> was certainly to connect the Crucifixion with the
Passover (in which the paschal lamb&mdash;symbolizing Isaac&mdash;was
customarily dressed in the form of a cross<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1701src" href="#xd23e1701" name="xd23e1701src">56</a>); and in
the fourth gospel Jesus becomes an actual Passover sacrifice. But the
narrative is simply a reduction to historic form of the procedure of a
customary ritual sacrifice, habitual usages of human sacrifice being
represented as expedients of a single Roman execution. With the exact
seasonal date of the Jesus Barabbas rite which here motived the gospel
legend, the myth-theory is not primarily concerned, though it has
secondary interest. It was probably a Spring Festival, and at the same
time a New Year Festival, the period of the vernal equinox having been
both in east and west the time of the New Year before that was placed
after the winter solstice. It is thus highly likely that there were
analogous sacrificial festivals at Yule and at Easter, one celebrating
the new-birth of the sun and the other the revival of vegetation. The
Sac&aelig;a festival may or may not have been identical with that known
from the monuments to have been called the Zakmuk<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1707src" href="#xd23e1707" name="xd23e1707src">57</a> (New Year):
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>either way, the features may have been the same.
There was in Judea, further, a hieratic year as well as a civil, a
Lesser Passover as well as the greater.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1716src" href="#xd23e1716" name="xd23e1716src">58</a> The
myth-theory does not depend on an agreed date, though the myth fixes on
an astronomical date, itself constantly varying in the calendar.</p>
<p class="par">What leaps to the eyes is that the gospel legend
preserves two separated features of the festival of a Sacrificed
Mock-King, which as incidents in the life of the Teacher are wholly
incompatible, and which the biographical theory cannot reasonably
explain&mdash;the acclaimed and welcomed Entry into Jerusalem and
within a week the demand of the city multitude for the crucifixion. The
Entry is an elaboration of several myth elements, but it contains the
item of the acclaimed ride of the quasi-king, mounted on an ass (or two
asses). If the biographical school would but consider historical
probabilities, they would realize that the story as told cannot be
historical, with or without the strange antithesis of the
multitude&rsquo;s speedy demand for the prophet&rsquo;s death. Such a
triumphal entry, for such a person as the gospel Jesus, could not
spontaneously have taken place: it must have been planned; and, if
arranged with such an effect as the record describes, it would have
given Pilate very sufficient ground for intervention without waiting
for a complaint from the priests. Taken as history, it is wholly
irreconcilable with the &ldquo;Crucify him&rdquo; ascribed to a
multitude whose support of Jesus had been affirmed the day before; and
accordingly M. Loisy, accepting the Entry, rejects the latter episode.
Strauss, hesitating to go, &ldquo;as has latterly often been
done,&rdquo; the length of rejecting the Entry on the ass as wholly
mythical, finds it very much so;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1726src"
href="#xd23e1726" name="xd23e1726src">59</a> and Brandt <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=

strongest suspicion of being framed upon Old Testament motives from
beginning to end.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1734src" href=
"#xd23e1734" name="xd23e1734src">60</a></p>
<p class="par">Thus the biographical school itself proffers <i>a</i>
myth-theory, without indicating an explanatory motive for the positing
of a contradiction. But when we realize that an acclamation of a
quasi-king riding on an ass was actually <i>part of the ritual</i> in a
sacrificial rite in which he <i>was to be</i> crucified, the two
clashing elements in the legend are at once explained in the full
myth-theory. Their separate handling and development was, just as
intelligibly, part of the process of gospel-making, the creation of an
ideal Jesus. But seeing that in the Sac&aelig;a festival the mock-king
had a <i>five days&rsquo; reign</i> between his start and his
death,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1753src" href="#xd23e1753" name=
"xd23e1753src">61</a> the original ritual gave the interval which in
the gospel story is filled with the acts of the Teaching God. Five days
is the accepted traditional interval from Palm Sunday to Crucifixion
Day.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">[Even for the item of the two asses in Matthew
there is a myth-explanation. Many writers of the biographical school,
who compensate themselves for their difficulties by ascribing a
peculiarly crass stupidity to the apostles and evangelists at every
opportunity, decide that the narrator or interpolator posited the two
asses, an ass and its colt, because he found in Zechariah a Messianic
prediction so phrased,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1762src" href=
"#xd23e1762" name="xd23e1762src">62</a> and did not understand that the
Hebraic idiom simply meant &ldquo;an ass.&rdquo; Yet one member of the
school, Dr. Conybeare, fiercely denounces myth-theorists for claiming
to understand Jewish symbolism better than the Jews did. Either
principle serves the turn. When Tertullian says that Jesus is the
Divine Fish because fishes were parthenogenetically born, and Jesus was
born again in the waters of the Jordan, Dr. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>Conybeare is sure of the wisdom of Tertullian.
This thesis, first found in Tertullian, is to decide the question, to
the exclusion of any reflection on the fact that the Sun at Easter had
before the Christian era passed from the sign Aries to the sign Pisces
in the zodiac. But when Matthew reads Zechariah&rsquo;s two asses as
meaning two asses, Matthew is to be dismissed as a Jew who did not
understand the commonest Hebrew idiom.</p>
<p class="par">The simple fact that the Septuagint does <i>not</i> give
the duplication, putting only &ldquo;a young colt,&rdquo; will serve to
indicate to any careful reader that the evangelist or interpolator was
following the Hebrew, and therefore is to be presumed to have known
something of Hebrew idiom. And the just critical inference is that
<i>both</i> passages had regard to the zodiacal figure of the Two Asses
for the sign Cancer, from which we have the myth of Bacchus riding on
two asses.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1790src" href="#xd23e1790" name=
"xd23e1790src">63</a> Further, it is probable that the similar passage
in the Song of Jacob<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1795src" href=
"#xd23e1795" name="xd23e1795src">64</a> has also a zodiacal basis.
These details, which Dr. Conybeare absolutely withholds from his
readers, indicate the mythological induction put by the present writer.
In an unconstruable sentence, Dr. Conybeare appears to argue<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1800src" href="#xd23e1800" name=
"xd23e1800src">65</a> that to secure any consideration for such a
thesis we must &ldquo;prove that the earliest Christians, who were
Jews, must have been familiar with the rare legend of Bacchus crossing
a marsh on two asses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;with the rare representation of
the zodiacal sign Cancer as an ass and its foal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">How the critic knows that the legend was rare at the
beginning of the Christian era he does not reveal; any more than he
gives his justification for calling the Asses sign rare in the face of
the statement of Lactantius that the Greeks call the sign of Cancer
&ldquo;(the) Asses.&rdquo; This reference was given by me, as also the
item that the sign of the Ass and Foal is Babylonian. It was thus very
likely to be known in the Semitic world. Yet Dr. Conybeare obliviously
informs us that &ldquo;it is next to impossible&rdquo; that it should
be known to &ldquo;the earliest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46"
href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>Christians,&rdquo; when all the
while he is arguing that Matthew was not the gospel of &ldquo;the
earliest Christians.&rdquo; It is in perfect keeping with this chaotic
procedure that he first oracularly refers me to Hyginus, whose version
of the myth of Bacchus and the asses I had actually cited and quoted;
and then, discovering that I had done so, yet leaving his written
exhortation unaltered, he announces that &ldquo;by Mr.
Robertson&rsquo;s own admission, Bacchus never rode on two asses at
all.&rdquo; It is difficult to be sure whether Dr. Conybeare does or
does not believe in the historicity of Bacchus, as he does in that of
Jesus; but seeing that Lactantius, as cited by me, expressly declares
that the two asses (= Cancer) carried Bacchus over the marsh, and that
Dr. Conybeare had already recognized that such a myth existed, his
absurd conclusion can be set down only to his habitual incoherence.</p>
<p class="par">I have dealt in detail with his futile criticism at this
point by way of putting the reader on his guard against the method of
bluster. Comparative mythology is a difficult and thorny field, but it
has to be explored; and Dr. Conybeare, whose study of the subject seems
to have begun in the year of the issue of his book,<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e1811src" href="#xd23e1811" name="xd23e1811src">66</a> does not
even discern the nature of its problems. He avowedly supposes that
totems are Gods; and he argues that the Jewish and Hellenistic world in
the age of Augustus was at the mythop&oelig;ic stage of the Australian
aborigines of to-day. Of the phenomena of iconographic myth he is
evidently quite ignorant; and his dithyramb on the sun myth tells of
nothing but obsolete debate on the question. And it is in this
connection that he informs his antagonists, in his now celebrated
academic manner, that they are &ldquo;a back number.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It has only to be added that as regards the documentary
problem, in this connection, Dr. Conybeare is equally distracted. It is
far from certain that at this point Mark&rsquo;s &ldquo;colt&rdquo; is
not a &ldquo;rectification&rdquo; of an original which Matthew
accepted. The assumption&mdash;negatived by themselves&mdash;that Mark
and Matthew as we have them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href=
"#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>are both primary forms, Matthew
always following and elaborating Mark, is one of the loose hypotheses
which such critics when it suits them take for certainties. But the
question of priority of form does not affect the fundamental issue. One
of the suggestions put by me which Dr. Conybeare has carefully withheld
from his readers&mdash;if, indeed, he ever really sees what is before
him&mdash;is that the item of the single ass or colt is probably a myth
with another basis. &ldquo;An ass tied&rdquo; appears to have been an
<i>Egyptian</i> symbol pointing to a solar date or a zodiacal or other
myth,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1824src" href="#xd23e1824" name=
"xd23e1824src">67</a> and this symbol, which is found in the Song of
Jacob, is the form put upon the Mark story by Justin Martyr. That the
other symbol had a long Christian vogue is indicated first by the fact
that there actually exists a Gnostic gem showing an ass suckling its
foal, with the figure of the crab (Cancer) above, and the inscription
<span lang="la">D.N. IHV. XPS., DEI FILIUS</span> = <i lang=
"la">Dominus Noster Jesu</i> (?) <i>Christus, Son of God</i>;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1839src" href="#xd23e1839" name=
"xd23e1839src">68</a> and, secondly, by the mention of the ass and foal
in the third Sermon of St. Proclus (5th c.).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1844src" href="#xd23e1844" name="xd23e1844src">69</a> These
details also Dr. Conybeare withholds from his readers, for the purposes
of his polemic.</p>
<p class="par">That we are dealing with a conflict of symbolisms will
probably be the inference of those who will face the facts. But Dr.
Conybeare, who is here in good company, is quite satisfied that behind
the Mark story of Jesus riding in a noisy procession <i>on an unbroken
colt</i> we have unquestionable history. There must be no nonsense
about two asses; but for him the story of the unbroken colt raises no
difficulty. He further simplifies the problem by summarizing Mark as
telling that &ldquo;an <i>insignificant</i> triumphal demonstration is
organized for him [Jesus] as he enters the sacred city on an
ass&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1860src" href="#xd23e1860" name=
"xd23e1860src">70</a> and by explaining that &ldquo;there was no other
way of entering Jerusalem unless you went on foot.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e1863src" href="#xd23e1863" name=
"xd23e1863src">71</a> The &ldquo;insignificant&rdquo; is held to be
sufficient to dispose of the problem of the Roman Governor&rsquo;s
entire indifference to a Messianic movement. Thus functions the
biographic method, in the hands of our academician. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">All the while, the item of the foal is, on his own
interpretation, a specified fulfilment of a prophecy, only in this case
the prophecy is in his opinion rightly understood, whereas in the
two-ass story it was misunderstood. By his own method, the critic is
committed to the position that the phrase &ldquo;whereon no man ever
yet sat&rdquo; is myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1871src" href=
"#xd23e1871" name="xd23e1871src">72</a> For serious critics in general,
this is sufficient to put in doubt the whole story. For our critic, a
story of a triumphal procession, with an unbroken colt, is simply
resolved into one of an &ldquo;insignificant procession,&rdquo; with an
ordinary donkey. Thus, under the pretence of extracting history from a
given document, the document is simply manipulated at will to suit a
presupposition. On this plan, the twelve labours of Herakles are simply
history exaggerated, and any one can make any Life of Herakles out of
it at his pleasure. We must not say that Una rode on a lion, but we may
infer that she rode on a small yellow pony. It is the method of the
early German deistic rationalists, according to which the story of
Jesus walking on the water is saved by the explanation that he was
walking on the shore.]</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Part of the demonstration of the myth-theory, again,
lies in the fact that the first act of Jesus after his entry is to
&ldquo;cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and
overthrow the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that
sold the doves.&rdquo; That this should have been accomplished without
resistance seemed to Origen so astonishing that he pronounced it among
the greatest miracles of Jesus,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1880src"
href="#xd23e1880" name="xd23e1880src">73</a> adding the skeptical
comment&mdash;&ldquo;if it really happened.&rdquo; The myth-theory may
here claim the support of Origen.</p>
<p class="par">Strauss could find no ground for rejecting the story as
myth upon his method of finding myth-motives only in the Old Testament.
If he had lived in our day he would probably have agreed that the
episode is singled out of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>the kinds of exploit which were
permitted to the victim in the Sac&aelig;a and the Saturnalia and such
primitive sacrificial festivals in general, and turned to a doctrinal
account. Such liberties as are described, all falling short of
sacrilege, are among those which could normally take place. It is by
way of anti-Judaism that the episode is utilized in the synoptics.</p>
<p class="par">In the fourth gospel, where so many matters are turned
to new account, and so much new doctrine introduced, the purification
is put with symbolic purpose at the outset of the Messiah&rsquo;s
career, in a visit to Jerusalem of which the synoptics know nothing;
and in this myth Jesus makes &ldquo;a scourge of small cords&rdquo; to
effect his purpose. That later item was probably suggested by the
effigy of the Egyptian Saviour God Osiris, who bears a scourge as the
God of retribution. In the synoptics there is no symbol: the story is
simply employed as part of the superadded didactic machinery which
alternately exhibits the full development of the Messiah and the
unfitness of the &ldquo;Jewish dispensation&rdquo; to continue.
Inferribly, the story of the fig-tree is in the same case, signifying
the condemnation of the Jewish cult, though here there may be a
concrete motive of which we have lost the clue. But it is significant
that while the gospel record could not possibly assign to the holy
Messiah such a general course as was followed by the licensed
sacrificial victim, it follows the story of his Entry with that of one
markedly disorderly act; whereafter he goes to lodge in Bethany
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2021:17">Mt. xxi,

(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=

becomes &ldquo;a sinner.&rdquo; Is not this another echo from the
obscure tragedy of the sacrificial victim, who was anointed for his
doom? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=

<p class="par first">Separately considered, the Crucifixion in the
gospel story is as impossible as the Entry. The cross, we are told, was
headed with an inscription: &ldquo;This is the King of the Jews.&rdquo;
Sir J. G. Frazer<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1915src" href="#xd23e1915"
name="xd23e1915src">74</a> and M. Salomon Reinach<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e1920src" href="#xd23e1920" name="xd23e1920src">75</a> concur in
recognizing that if the victim had really been executed on the charge
of making such a claim, no Roman governor would have dared so to
endorse it.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1925src" href="#xd23e1925" name=
"xd23e1925src">76</a> The argument is that only by turning the
execution into a celebration of a popular rite could the procedure have
been made officially acceptable. But to extract such an explanation
from the record is simply to stultify it as such. <i>If</i> there
really occurred such a manipulation of the death-scene of an adored
Teacher, how could the narrators possibly fail to say as much? We are
asked by the biographical school to believe that the Crucifixion was
made a farce-tragedy by treating the Teacher as the victim in a
well-known rite of human sacrifice, and also to believe that the
devotees who preserved the record, knowing this fact, chose to say
nothing about it, preferring to represent the procedure as a unique
incident.</p>
<p class="par">It might perhaps be argued, on the biographical view,
that the Roman soldiers, who are held to have been Asiatics, chose to
improvise a version of a sacrificial rite which was <i>unknown</i> to
the Jesuists, and that the latter simply reported the episode without
understanding it, interpreting it from their prophets in their own way.
But if the record be historical it is incredible that in a cult which
is claimed to have made many adherents throughout the Roman Empire in
east and west in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span>generation or two, it should not quickly have
become known that the procedure of the Crucifixion was a copy of
popular eastern and western rites of human sacrifice. If there had
taken place what the hypothesis suggests, there was a purposive
suppression. That is to say, the credibility of the narrative is at
this point vitally impeached by a supporter of the biographical theory,
which expressly rests on the narrative as regards non-miraculous
data.</p>
<p class="par">And while on the one hand it is in effect charged with
the gravest <i lang="la">suppressio veri</i>, on the other it is
charged, equally in the name of the biographical view, with something
more than <i lang="la">suggestio falsi</i>, with absolute fiction. M.
Loisy does not merely dismiss the Barabbas story as unhistorical,
offering no explanation of its strange presence: he comes critically to
the conclusion that Jesus on the cross uttered no word, whether of
despair, entreaty, or resignation. We need not ask what kind of credit
M. Loisy can ask for a record which he thus so gravely discredits. The
scientific question is, Upon what grounds can he demur to the extension
of a myth-theory to which he thus contributes? If the record admittedly
invented utterances for the Teacher on the cross, why should not the
whole be an invention? In particular, why should not the trial before
Pilate and the inscription on the cross be inventions?</p>
<p class="par">The inscription on the cross, we see, is for the great
anthropologist of the school impossible save as part of a simulated
ritual. M. Loisy, supporting the same general thesis, declares that
&ldquo;to say Jesus was not condemned to death as king of the Jews,
that is to say, as Messiah, on his own avowal, <i>amounts to saying</i>
[<i lang="fr">autant vaut soutenir</i>] <i>that he never
existed</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1957src" href=
"#xd23e1957" name="xd23e1957src">77</a> It is even so; and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>the
supporter of the myth-theory is thus doubly justified. The loyal
induction is, not that in any rite of human sacrifice exactly such a
label was affixed to the gibbet, but that probably some label was, and
that the gospel framers (or one of them) &ldquo;invented&rdquo; a label
which stated their claim for Jesus as Messiah. It was a fairly skilful
thing to do, representing the label as a Roman mockery, and thereby
making it an appeal to every Jew.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1965src"
href="#xd23e1965" name="xd23e1965src">78</a> It is indeed conceivable
that Roman soldiers taking part, once in a way, in the rite of Jesus
Barabbas, may have turned that to a purpose of contempt by labelling
the poor mock-king as the king of the Jews. But such an episode would
not be the enactment of the scene described in the record. It would
merely be a hint for it, the acceptance of which was but an additional
item of fiction.</p>
<p class="par">That the Crucifixion, as described, is a normal act of
ritual human sacrifice, is even more true than it is shown to be by the
parallels of the Sac&aelig;a and the Saturnalia. The scourging, the
royal robe, the mock crown, were all parts of those rituals, which thus
conform in parody to the ritual of the mythic sacrifice of Ieoud, son
of Kronos, probably parodied in the ritual for the victim sacrificed to
Kronos at Rhodes. But so are the drink of wine and myrrh, the
leg-breaking, and the piercing with the spear. The crown is a feature
of all ancient sacrifice, in all parts of the world. Crowns of flowers
were normal in the case of human victims, in India, in Mexico, in
Greece, and among the North-American Indians, as in ordinary animal
sacrifice among the Greeks, Romans, and Semites. But even the crown of
thorns had a special religious vogue in Egypt, procured as such crowns
were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>from thorn-trees near Abydos whose branches curled
into garland-form. Prometheus the Saviour, too, receives from Zeus a
crown of osiers; and his worshippers wore crowns in his
honour.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1975src" href="#xd23e1975" name=
"xd23e1975src">79</a> Either some such special motive or the common
practice in the popular rite will account for the record.</p>
<p class="par">And these items of the mock-king ritual exclude the
argument which might possibly be brought from the fact that in the
ancient world, as among primitives in general, all executions, as such,
tend to assume the sacrificial form. The condemned criminal is
&ldquo;devoted,&rdquo; <i lang="la">sacer</i>, taboo, even as is the
simply sacrificed victim, becoming the appanage of the God as is the
God&rsquo;s representative who is sacrificed <i>to</i> the
God.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e1988src" href="#xd23e1988" name=
"xd23e1988src">80</a> It might therefore be argued that a man condemned
on purely political grounds could be treated as a sacrificial victim.
But there is no instance of the criminal executed <i>as such</i> being
treated as the mock-king. A criminal might be turned to that account,
but that would be by special arrangement: executed simply as a
criminal, he would not be crowned and royally robed. These details were
features of specific sacrifices: executions were only generically
sacrificial, and were of course in no way honorary. In the gospel
story, the two thieves are neither mocked, robed, nor crowned. They are
not &ldquo;Sons of the Father,&rdquo; or deputies of the King.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The question here arises, however, whether the
triple execution was a customary rite. All executions being, as
aforesaid, quasi-sacrificial, an ordinary execution <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>might
conceivably be combined with a specific sacrifice. It is to be observed
that no mention of the triple execution occurs outside of the gospels:
the Acts and the Epistles have no allusion to it. It is thus
conceivably, as was hinted by Strauss, a late addition to the myth,
motived by the verse now omitted as spurious from Mark (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2015:28">xv, 28</a>),
but preserved in Luke (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2022:37">xxii,
37</a>): &ldquo;And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And he was
reckoned with transgressors.&rdquo; But we are bound to consider the
possibility that the triple execution was ritually primordial.</p>
<p class="par">The story of such an execution in the &ldquo;Acts of
Saint Hitzibouzit,&rdquo; martyred at some time in Persia, is evidently
doubtful evidence for the practice, as Sir J. G. Frazer observes. The
record runs that the saint was &ldquo;offered up as a sacrifice between
two malefactors on a hill top opposite the sun and before all the
multitude,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2027src" href="#xd23e2027"
name="xd23e2027src">81</a> suggesting that the sacrifice was a solar
one. This is possible; but martyrology is dubious testimony. On the
other hand Mr. W. R. Paton has suggested that the triple execution was
a Persian practice, and was made to a triple God.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e2032src" href="#xd23e2032" name="xd23e2032src">82</a> There is
the notable support of the statement in a fragment of Ctesias (36) that
the Egyptian usurper Inarus was crucified by Artaxerxes the First
between two thieves. In addition to the cases of Greek sacrifices of
three victims may be noted one among the Dravidians of
Jeypore;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2037src" href="#xd23e2037" name=
"xd23e2037src">83</a> and the practice among the Khonds of placing the
victim between two shrubs. In the Jeypore case one victim was
sacrificed at the east, one at the west, and one at the centre of a
village; and in another case two victims were sacrificed every third
year. A triple execution might be a special event, in which two
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>victims were both actually and ritually criminals,
in order to enhance the divinity of the third. And we know that triple
sacrifices did occur. The throwing of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
into the fiery furnace was ostensibly a triple sacrifice: it will
hardly be claimed as a historical episode in its subsisting form.</p>
<p class="par">On a careful balance, however, the presumption seems
rather against a triple rite. What is quite clear is that for the early
Jesuists the &ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; in 53rd Isaiah possessed the
highest importance. For us, that lyric chapter is still somewhat
enigmatic. Gunkel, who is here followed by Professor Drews,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e2046src" href="#xd23e2046" name=
"xd23e2046src">84</a> takes the view that the suffering figure
described is really that of the typical victim of the human sacrifice;
and it certainly fits that conception at points where it does not

"noteref" id="xd23e2051src" href="#xd23e2051" name=
"xd23e2051src">85</a> The victim <i>was</i> &ldquo;wounded for our
transgressions, bruised for our iniquities&rdquo;; and conceptually
&ldquo;with his stripes we are healed.&rdquo; On the other hand, who
were &ldquo;we&rdquo; for &ldquo;Isaiah&rdquo; if not Israel itself?
The only interpretation seems to be that the past generations had
suffered for the present; and this does not yield an intellectually
satisfying figure. But still more improbable, on the whole, is the
suggestion that the Hebrew prophet or quasi-prophetic
lyrist&mdash;whatever date we may assign to the chapter&mdash;has
really perceived and figured the tragic vision of the sacrificial
victim as he is here supposed to have done. It would be a psychological
feat extremely remarkable even for that highly gifted writer;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e2060src" href="#xd23e2060" name=
"xd23e2060src">86</a> and moreover it would finally compose still less
with the general <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>idea of the context than does the supposed
presentment of the suffering People. It is difficult to reach any
satisfying notion of Isaiah&rsquo;s general meaning on the view of
Gunkel and Drews.</p>
<p class="par">We are thus far held, then, to the inference that, as
Isaiah&rsquo;s chapter was certainly taken by the early
Christists<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2072src" href="#xd23e2072" name=
"xd23e2072src">87</a> who had adopted the Messianic idea to be a
prophecy of their Messiah, the Christ myth was shaped in accordance
with it. There are three main strands in the Christ myth, the Jesuist,
the Christist or Messianic, and that of the Teaching God. The
&ldquo;suffering&rdquo; motive serves to bind the three together; and
the concrete item, &ldquo;he was numbered with the
transgressors,&rdquo; bracketed as it is with &ldquo;he poured out his
soul unto death,&rdquo; gives a very definite ground for the item of
the forced companionship of the malefactors in the Crucifixion scene.
It is, in short, apparently one of the specifically Judaic motives in
the myth construction. Earlier in the narrative the Messiah is
frequently grouped with &ldquo;publicans and sinners&rdquo;: he comes
&ldquo;eating and drinking,&rdquo; in contrast with the ascetic figure
of the Baptist. That feature is probably part of the atmosphere of the
myth-motive of the sacrificial victim, with the leper-host and the
anointing by the &ldquo;sinner.&rdquo; But the &ldquo;two
thieves&rdquo; are inferribly supplied from another side.</p>
<p class="par">In the first two gospels, the character of the unnamed
anointress is tacitly suggested by the very reticence of the
description, &ldquo;a woman.&rdquo; In Jewry and in the East
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>generally, the woman who went freely into
men&rsquo;s houses was declassed; and the &ldquo;sinner&rdquo; of Luke
was only a specification of the already hinted. But the story in Luke
of the homage of the good thief is clearly new myth, coming of the
widened ethic of the &ldquo;gospel of the Gentiles.&rdquo; Matthew and
Mark have no thought of anything but the association of the Messiah
with typical transgressors in death: for them the two thieves are
hostile. The &ldquo;Gentile&rdquo; gospel improves the occasion by
converting one of the transgressors. No critical inquirer, presumably,
now fails to see doctrinal myth at the second stage. It is only the
atmosphere of presupposition that can keep it imperceptible in the
first. In the making of the gospels, ritual myth, doctrinal myth, and
traditional myth are co-factors; and it may be that even where
doctrinal myth is quite clearly at work, as in the staging of the
Messianic death &ldquo;with transgressors,&rdquo; an actual ritual is
also commemorated.</p>

and Myth Elements</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the later myth the robbers, as it happens, are
made to embody certain features of sacrificial ritual. We are told in
the fourth gospel that the Jews &ldquo;asked of Pilate that their legs
might be broken, and that they might be taken
away,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;that the bodies should not remain on the
cross upon the sabbath, for the day of that sabbath was a high
day.&rdquo; Accordingly the soldiers break the legs of the two thieves,
&ldquo;but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
they brake not his legs.&rdquo; The implication is that the men&rsquo;s
legs were to be broken by way of killing them&mdash;a patently untrue
suggestion.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2091src" href="#xd23e2091" name=
"xd23e2091src">88</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58"
name="pb58">58</a>]</span>The spear-thrust which &ldquo;howbeit&rdquo;
was given to Jesus would have been the way of killing the others if
they were alive: breaking the legs was a brutality which would not
ensure death.</p>
<p class="par">The explanation is that both leg-breaking and spearing
were features of sacrificial rites. It may have been by way of
purposive contrast to the former procedure that in the priestly
ritual<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2101src" href="#xd23e2101" name=
"xd23e2101src">89</a> of the passover it is enacted that no bone of the
(unspecified) victim shall be broken. The breaking of the leg-bones in
human sacrifice was one of the horrible expedients of the primitive
world for securing the apparent willingness of the victim: it is to be
found alike in Dravidian and in African sacrifice.<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e2112src" href="#xd23e2112" name="xd23e2112src">90</a> An
alternative method, which tended to supersede the other, was that of
drugging or intoxication, of which we find still more widespread
evidence. In ancient Jerusalem, we find the practice transferred to
ordinary execution on the cross, the humane women making a practice of
giving a narcotic potion of wine and incense to the victim.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e2117src" href="#xd23e2117" name=
"xd23e2117src">91</a> Thus associated with the deaths of ordinary
criminals, it suggested to some of the Jesuist myth-makers a ground for
specializing the record.</p>
<p class="par">In the first two gospels, a drink is offered to Jesus on
the cross&mdash;wine<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2127src" href=
"#xd23e2127" name="xd23e2127src">92</a> mingled with gall, in Matthew;
wine mingled with myrrh in Mark&mdash;&ldquo;but he received it
not&rdquo;; this, in Matthew, after tasting. The Marcan form is
probably the first, as it describes the customary narcotic: the idea is
to indicate that in the case of the divine victim no artifice was
needed to secure an apparent acquiescence: he was a voluntary sufferer.
&ldquo;Gall,&rdquo; in Matthew, may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59"
href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>have reference to pagan
mysteries in which a drink of gall figured.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e2132src" href="#xd23e2132" name="xd23e2132src">93</a> In Luke,
vinegar is ostensibly offered as part of the derision. In John, no
drink is mentioned till the end, when the dying victim says, &ldquo;I
thirst.&rdquo; Having partaken of &ldquo;a sponge full of the vinegar
upon hyssop,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;It is finished,&rdquo; and dies. In
Matthew, this act of compassion takes a simpler form, the sponge of
vinegar being given on the utterance of the despairing cry, while other
bystanders jeer: in Mark, the giver of the sponge also jeers.</p>
<p class="par">It is needless to debate long over the priorities of
such details: as regards the drink of vinegar, all alike have regard to
<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2069:21">Psalm
lxix, 21</a>: &ldquo;They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my
thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.&rdquo; For that reason, the
wine-and-myrrh item is probably primordial: it tells of the sacrificial
rite; and the drink of vinegar is a doctrinal addition; even as the
rejection of the narcotic is doctrinal. For the variations which
distinguish each narrative from the others, there is no reasonable
explanation on the biographical view: if devoted onlookers could not
preserve the truth at such a point, where could they be trusted? The
mythical interpretation alone makes all intelligible.</p>
<p class="par">The fourth gospel, with its tale of the leg-breaking,
supplies the strongest ground for surmising the occasional occurrence
of a triple rite, in which the lesser victims were treated as
sacrificed slaves normally have been in African and other human
sacrifice, while the central victim was put on another footing. The
express enactment in regard to the mysterious paschal sacrifice
suggests that bone-breaking took place in others. In all likelihood,
the original paschal sacrifice was that of a human victim of specially
high grade: the substitution of the lamb <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>was part of the process
of civilization indicated in the myth of Abraham and Isaac. And if the
knowledge of the death-rite of Jesus Barabbas could subsist in the
first century or later, knowledge of an early triple rite could subsist
also. But this remains open to doubt, though at several points the
fourth gospel specially emphasizes the historical derivation of the
cult from a sacrament of blood sacrifice.</p>
<p class="par">Nowhere else is the literal basis of the symbol of
&ldquo;body and blood&rdquo; so insisted upon. Its writers had present
to their minds an actual ritual in which the eating of the body of a
Sacrificed God, first actually, then symbolically, was of cardinal
importance. The later myth puts new stress on the conception, as if it
had been felt that the earlier was not sufficiently explicit; and it
makes the Jewish high-priest lay down the doctrine of human sacrifice
from the Judaic side.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2148src" href=
"#xd23e2148" name="xd23e2148src">94</a> It is in this atmosphere of
sacrificial ideas that we get the item of the piercing of the divine
victim with a spear. The detail is turned specially to the account of
the Johannine doctrine of resurrection by putting what passed in
popular physiology for a certain proof of death&mdash;the issuing of
&ldquo;blood and water.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2153src"
href="#xd23e2153" name="xd23e2153src">95</a> But here again we find
both a Hebrew motive<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2156src" href=
"#xd23e2156" name="xd23e2156src">96</a> and a pagan motive for the
detail. In the sacrifice of the sacred slave of the Moon-Goddess among
the primitive Albanians, the victim was allowed the customary year of
luxury and licence, and was finally anointed and slain by being pierced
to the heart with a sacred lance through the side. And there are other
eastern analogues.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2161src" href=
"#xd23e2161" name="xd23e2161src">97</a></p>
<p class="par">It is the fourth gospel, finally, that introduces the
&ldquo;garment without seam,&rdquo; combining a Hebraic with a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span>pagan motive. In order to fulfil a
&ldquo;prophecy&rdquo; held to be Messianic,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e2170src" href="#xd23e2170" name="xd23e2170src">98</a> the
synoptics make the soldiers cast lots for the garments of Jesus. The
fourth gospel specifies a simple allotment of the garments in general,
as if they could have been numerous enough to go round the soldiery,
but limits the act of &ldquo;casting lots&rdquo; to the <i>chiton</i>,
the under garment. Thus the soldiers both &ldquo;divide the
raiment&rdquo; <i>and</i> cast lots for the &ldquo;vesture.&rdquo; The
making of this &ldquo;without seam&rdquo; is at once an assimilation of
Jesus to the high-priest and an assimilation of the Slain God to the
Sun-God and other deities.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2184src" href=
"#xd23e2184" name="xd23e2184src">99</a> A special <i>chiton</i> was
woven for Apollo in Sparta; as a <i>peplos</i> or shawl was woven for
H&ecirc;r&ecirc; at Elis. And this in turn had for the pre-Christian
pagans mystic meanings as symbolizing the indivisible solar robe of
universal light, ascribed to Osiris; the partless robe of Ahura Mazda;
Pan&rsquo;s coat of many colours, and yet other notions. Always the
story is itemized in terms of myth, of ritual, of symbol, of doctrine,
never in terms of real biography.</p>

Cross</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is not at all certain, and it is not probable,
that in the earlier stages of the myth the cross as such was prominent.
Early crucifixion was not always a nailing of outstretched hands in the
cross form, but often a hanging of the victim by the arms, tied
together at the wrists, with or without a support to the body at the
thighs.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2205src" href="#xd23e2205" name=
"xd23e2205src">100</a> The <i>stauros</i> was not necessarily a cross:
it might be a simple pile or stake. In the Book of Acts (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205:30">v, 30</a>)
Peter and the Apostles are made to speak of Jesus &ldquo;whom ye slew,
hanging him on a tree.&rdquo; This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>was in itself a common
sacrificial mode; and all sacrificial traditions are more or less
represented in the New Testament compilation.</p>
<p class="par">But there was an irresistible compulsion to a divinizing
of the cross as of the victim. Ages before the Christian era the symbol
had been mystic and sacrosanct for Semites, for Egyptians, for Greeks,
for Hindus; and the Sacred Tree of the cults of Attis, Dionysos, and
Osiris lent itself alike to many symbolic significances.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e2220src" href="#xd23e2220" name=
"xd23e2220src">101</a> The cross had reference to the equinox, when the
sacred tree was cut down; to the victim bound to it; to the four points
of the compass; to the zodiacal sign Aries, thus connected with the
sacrificial lamb;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2233src" href="#xd23e2233"
name="xd23e2233src">102</a> and to the universe as symbolized in the
&ldquo;orb&rdquo; of the emperor, with the cross-lines drawn on it. The
final Christian significance of the cross is a composite of ideas
associated with it everywhere, from Mexico to the Gold Coast, in both
of which regions it was or is a symbol of the Rain-God.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e2238src" href="#xd23e2238" name=
"xd23e2238src">103</a> The Dravidian victim, the deified sacrifice, was
as-it-were crucified;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2246src" href=

African sacrificial practice points to its general antiquity.</p>
<p class="par">It would appear, too, that in the mysteries of the
Saviour Gods not only a crucified aspect of the God but a simulation of
that on the part of the devotees was customary. Osiris was actually
represented in crucifix form;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2258src" href=
"#xd23e2258" name="xd23e2258src">106</a> and in the ritual the
worshipper became &ldquo;one with Osiris,&rdquo; apparently by being

pointed to the Syrian practice of <i>stigmata</i>, which appears to
connect with both Osirian and Christian usage. In his remarkable
account of the life of the sacred city of Hierapolis&mdash;a microcosm
of eastern paganism&mdash;Lucian, after telling how children are
sacrificed with the votive pretence that they are oxen, records that it
is the universal practice to make punctures in the neck or in the
hands, and that &ldquo;all&rdquo; Syrians bear such
<i>stigmata</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2295src" href="#xd23e2295"
name="xd23e2295src">110</a> One of the principal cults of the place was
that of Attis, the castrated God of Vegetation, in whose mysteries the
image of a youth was bound to a tree,<a class="noteref" id=

ritual of suffering, mourning, resurrection and rejoicing. As Dionysos
was also &ldquo;he of the tree,&rdquo; it is not improbable that he,
who also died to rise again, may have been similarly adored. On the
other hand, the representation of the Saviour Prometheus suffering in a
crucified posture tells of an immemorial concept.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By way of accounting for the Jewish refusal to see
in Jesus the promised Messiah, orthodox exegesis has spread widely the
belief that it was no part of the Messianic idea that the Anointed One
should die an ignominious death; and some of us began by accepting that
account of the case. Clearly it was not the traditional or generally
prevailing Jewish expectation. Yet in the Acts we find Peter and Paul
alike (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2024:44-46">44&ndash;46</a>)
the same assertion is put in the mouth of Jesus. Either then the
exegetes regard these assertions as unfounded or they admit that one
school of interpretation in Jewry found a number of
&ldquo;prophetical&rdquo; passages which foretold the Messiah&rsquo;s
exemplary death. And the A. V. margin refers us to <a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2022">Ps. xxii</a>;

<p class="par">Now, these are adequate though not numerous documentary
grounds for the doctrine, on Jewish principles of interpretation.
Jewish, indeed, the Messianic idea is not in origin: it is
Perso-Babylonian;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2368src" href="#xd23e2368"
name="xd23e2368src">116</a> and the idea of a suffering or re-arising
Messiah may well have come in from that side. But equally that may have
found some Jewish acceptance. We can see very well that in Daniel
&ldquo;the Anointed One&rdquo;&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the Messiah&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo;&mdash;refers to the Maccabean hero; but
that as well as the other passages, on Jewish principles, could apply
to the Messiah of any period; and the Septuagint reading of <a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2022:16">Psalm xxii,
16</a>: &ldquo;They pierced my hands and my feet,&rdquo; was a
specification of crucifixion. It is not impossible that that reading
was the result of the actual crucifixion of Cyrus, who had been
specified as a &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65"
href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>in Isaiah. We have nothing to do
here with rational interpretation: the whole conception of prophecy is
irrational; but the construing of old texts as prophecies was a Jewish
specialty.</p>
<p class="par">When then a theistic rationalist of the last generation
wrote of the gospel Jesus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">His being a carpenter, occupying the field of
barbaric Galilee, and suffering death as a culprit, are not features
which the constructor of an imaginary tale would go out of his way to
introduce wherewith to associate his hero, and therefore, probably, we
have here real facts presented to us,<a class="noteref" id=

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">he was far astray. Anything might be predicated of a
Jewish Messiah. Not only had the Messianic Cyrus been crucified: the
anointed and triumphant Judas Maccab&aelig;us, under whose auspices the
Messianic belief had revived in Israel in the second century
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>, had finally fallen in battle; and his
brother Simon, who was actually regarded as the Messiah, was murdered
by his son-in-law.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2397src" href=
"#xd23e2397" name="xd23e2397src">118</a></p>
<p class="par">It is not here argued that the Messianic idea had been
originally connected with the Jesus cult; on the contrary that cult is
presented as a non-national one, surviving in parts of Palestine in
connection with belief in an ancient deity and the practice of an
ancient rite, in a different religious atmosphere from that of
Messianism. The solution to which we shall find ourselves led is that
at a certain stage the Messianic idea was grafted on the cultus; and
this stage is likely to have begun after the fall of Jerusalem, when
for most Jews the hope of a Maccabean recovery was buried. Then it was
that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=

above,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2407src" href="#xd23e2407"
name="xd23e2407src">119</a> supernaturally empowered to make an end of
the earthly scene, became the only plausible one; and here the
conception of a Slain God who, like all slain Gods, rose again, invited
the development. Jesuists could now make a new appeal to Jews in
general upon recognizably Jewish lines. They were of course resisted,
even as Sadducees were resisted by Pharisees, and <i>vice versa</i>.
The statement in the <span class="sc">Messiah</span> article in the
<i lang="la">Encyclop&aelig;dia Biblica</i> that it is highly
improbable that &ldquo;<i>the</i> Jews&rdquo; at the time of Christ
believed in a suffering and atoning Messiah is nugatory. No one ever
put such a proposition. But &ldquo;the Jews&rdquo; had in course of
time added much to their creed, and might have added this, were it not
that the Jesus cult became identified with Gentile and anti-Judaic
propaganda.</p>
<p class="par">In any case the idea arose among Jews, and quite
intelligibly. The picture drawn by Isaiah was a standing incitement to
the rise of a cult whose Hero-God had been slain. It was the one kind
of Messianic cult which the Romans would leave unmolested. At the same
time it committed the devotees to the position that the Messiah must
come <i>again</i>, &ldquo;in the clouds, in great glory&rdquo;; and the
Christian Church was actually established on that conception, which
sufficed to sustain it till the earthly Providence of the State came to
the rescue. Some of its modern adherents have not hesitated to boast
that the common expectation of the speedy end of the world gave the
infant Church a footing not otherwise obtainable. It was certainly a
<i lang="la">conditio sine qua non</i> for Christianity in its
infancy.</p>
<p class="par">As for the item of &ldquo;the carpenter,&rdquo; we have
seen<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2439src" href="#xd23e2439" name=

Tomb</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the first gospel (<a class="biblink xd23e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2027:57">xxvii, 57</a>
<i>sq.</i>) we have a comparatively simple version of the story of
Joseph of Arimathea, a rich disciple of Jesus, who gets the dead body
of the crucified, wraps it in clean linen, and lays it &ldquo;in his
own new tomb, which he had hewed out in the rock.&rdquo; In Mark and
Luke we have visibly elaborated accounts, in which, however, while the
rock tomb is specified, it is not described as Joseph&rsquo;s
&ldquo;own,&rdquo; though it is represented as hitherto unused. Such a
narrative points very directly to the Mithraic rite in which the stone
image of the dead God, after being ritually mourned over, is laid in a
tomb, which, Mithra being &ldquo;the God out of the rock,&rdquo; would
naturally be of stone&mdash;a simple matter in a cult whose chief rites
were always enacted in a cave.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2463src"
href="#xd23e2463" name="xd23e2463src">121</a> Details thus thrown into
special prominence, while in themselves historically insignificant, can
be understood only as mythically motived. So noticeable is the Mithraic
parallel that the Christian Father who angrily records it exclaims,
<i lang="la">Habet ergo diabolus Christos suos</i>&mdash;&ldquo;the
devil thus has his Christs.&rdquo; In Mithraism the rock tomb, which is
an item in a ritual of death and resurrection, is mythically motived
throughout: in the gospel story, historically considered, the item is
meaningless.</p>
<p class="par">Obvious as is the mythological inference, it is met by
the assertion that round Jerusalem &ldquo;soil was so scarce that every
one was buried in a rock tomb.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e2479src" href="#xd23e2479" name="xd23e2479src">122</a> Such a
criticism at once defeats itself. If every one was buried in a rock
tomb, what was the point of the emphasised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>detail
in the gospels, which are so devoid of details of a really biographical
character? Obviously, rock tombs were the specialty of the rich; and
Joseph of Arimathea is described in all the synoptics as a man of
social standing. Is the motive of the story nothing better than the
desire to record that Jesus was richly buried?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Scores of such tombs remain,&rdquo; cries the
critic: &ldquo;were they all Mithraic?&rdquo; The argument thus evaded
is that there was <i>no</i> real tomb. If there was one thing which the
early Jesuists, on the biographical theory, might be supposed to keep
hold of, it was the place of their Lord&rsquo;s sepulchre; yet nothing
subsists but an admittedly false tradition. At Jerusalem, as one has
put it, there are shown &ldquo;two Zions, two Temple areas, two
Bethanys, two Gethsemanes, two or more Calvarys, three Holy Sepulchres,
several Bethesdas.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2492src" href=
"#xd23e2492" name="xd23e2492src">123</a> It is all myth. &ldquo;There
is not a single existing site in the Holy City that is mentioned in
connection with Christian history before the year 326 <span class=

footprints of Christ on Olivet.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

"#xd23e2506" name="xd23e2506src">125</a> &ldquo;The position of the
traditional sites of Calvary and the Holy Sepulchre, in the middle of
the north quarter of Jerusalem, seems to have given rise to suspicions
very early.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2515src" href=
"#xd23e2515" name="xd23e2515src">126</a> It well might. I have known a
modern traveller who, on seeing the juxtaposed sites, at once realized
that he was on the scene, if of anything, of an ancient ritual, not of
events such as are narrated in the gospels. The traditional Golgotha is
only fifty or sixty yards away from the Sepulchre;<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e2518src" href="#xd23e2518" name="xd23e2518src">127</a> and
near by is &ldquo;Mount Moriah,&rdquo; upon <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>which
Abraham is recorded to have sought to sacrifice Isaac.</p>
<p class="par">Colonel Conder, who accepts without misgiving all four
gospel narratives, and attempts to combine them, avows that the
&ldquo;Garden Tomb&rdquo; chosen by General Gordon, in the latterly
selected Calvary, is impossible, being probably a work of the twelfth
century;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2528src" href="#xd23e2528" name=
"xd23e2528src">128</a> and for his own part, while inclined to stand by
the new Golgotha, avows that &ldquo;we must still say of our Lord as
was said of Moses, &lsquo;No man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this
day.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2531src" href=
"#xd23e2531" name="xd23e2531src">129</a> Placidly he concludes that
&ldquo;it is well that we should not know.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e2536src" href="#xd23e2536" name="xd23e2536src">130</a> But what
does the biographical theory make of such a conclusion? Its fundamental
assumption is that of Renan, that the personality of Jesus was so
commanding as to make his disciples imagine his resurrection. In
elaborate and contradictory detail we have the legends of that; and yet
we find that all trace of knowledge alike of place of crucifixion and
tomb had vanished from the Christian community which is alleged to have
arisen immediately after his ascension. The theory collapses at a
touch, here as at every other point. There is no more a real Sepulchre
of Jesus than there is a real Sepulchre of Mithra; and the bluster
which offers the solution that at Jerusalem every one was buried in a
rock tomb is a mere closing of the eyes to the monumental fact of the
myth.</p>
<p class="par">The critic is all the while himself committed to the
denial that there was any tomb. Professing to follow the
suggestion<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2543src" href="#xd23e2543" name=
"xd23e2543src">131</a> of M. Loisy that Jesus was thrown into
&ldquo;<i>some</i> common foss,&rdquo; which in his hands becomes
&ldquo;<i>the</i> common <i>pit reserved for crucified
malefactors</i>,&rdquo; he affirms<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2561src"
href="#xd23e2561" name="xd23e2561src">132</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>that
&ldquo;the words ascribed in <a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:29">Acts xiii,
29</a>, to Paul certainly favour the Abb&eacute;&rsquo;s view.&rdquo;
They certainly do not. The text in question runs:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">And when they had fulfilled all things that were
written of him they took him down <i>from the tree</i>, and <i>laid him
in a tomb</i>.</p>

"mn&#275;meion"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&mu;&nu;&eta;&mu;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>&mdash;that
used in the gospel story. There is thus no support whatever either for
the suggestion of &ldquo;a common foss&rdquo; or for the allegation
about &ldquo;<i>the</i> common pit reserved for crucified
malefactors&rdquo;&mdash;a wholly unwarranted figment. The second
&ldquo;they&rdquo; of the sentence is indefinite: it may mean either
the Jews of the previous sentence or another &ldquo;they&rdquo;: but
either way it expressly posits a tomb. Yet after this deliberate
perversion of the document, which of course he does not quote, the
critic proceeds (p. 302) to aver that &ldquo;<i>the genuine tradition
of Jesus having been cast by his enemies into the common pit reserved
for malefactors</i> ... survived among the Jews&rdquo;; and that the
tomb story was invented as &ldquo;the most effective way of
meeting&rdquo; the imagined statement. Such an amateur inventor of myth
is naturally resentful of mythological tests!</p>

Resurrection</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">If a suffering Messiah was arguable for the Jews,
his resurrection after death was a matter of course. The biographical
theory, that the greatness of the Founder&rsquo;s personality led his
followers to believe that he <i>must</i> rise again, is historically as
unwarrantable as any part of the biographical case. The death and
resurrection of the Saviour-God was an outstanding feature of all the
most popular cults of the near East; Osiris, Herakles, Dionysos, Attis,
Adonis, Mithra, all died to rise again; and a ritual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>of
burial, mourning, resurrection, and rejoicing was common to several. On
any view such rituals were established in other contemporary cults; and
it is this fact that makes it worth while in this inquiry to glance at
a myth which is now abandoned by all save the traditionally
orthodox.</p>
<p class="par">On the uncritical assumption that nothing but pure
Judaism could exist in Jewry in the age of the Herods, the notion of a
dying and re-arising Hero-God was impossible among Jews save as a
result of a stroke of new constructive faith. That simple negative
position ignores not only the commonness of the belief in immortality
among Jews (the Pharisees all held it) before the Christian era, but
the special Jewish beliefs in the &ldquo;translation&rdquo; of Moses
and Elijah, and the story of Saul, the witch of Endor, and the spirit
of Samuel. The very belief that the risen Elias was to be the
forerunner of the Messiah was a lead to the belief that the Messiah
himself might come after a resurrection.</p>
<p class="par">But it is practically certain that a liturgical
resurrection was or had been <i>practised</i> in contemporary cults
which had at one time enacted an annual sacrifice of the representative
of the God, abstracted in myth as the death of the God himself. And in
our own time the survival of an analogous practice has been noted in
India. At the installation of the Rajahs of Keonjhur it was anciently
the practice for the Rajah to slay a victim: latterly there is a
mock-slaying, whereupon the mock-victim disappears. &ldquo;He must not
be seen for three days; then he presents himself to the Rajah as
miraculously restored to life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

Joseph McCabe (<i>Sources of Gospel Morality</i>, p. 21) argues against
the myth-theory that the early Rabbis never question the historicity of
Jesus. But it is extremely likely that early Rabbis <i>did</i> use the

hardly be said, used for the sake of exactitude. The term &ldquo;early

There were Jesuists and Christists before the &ldquo;Christian&rdquo;
movement arose. Dr. Conybeare pronounces such terms
&ldquo;jargon&rdquo; (<i>Histor. Christ</i>, p. 94). In the next line
he illustrates the delicacy of his own academic taste by the terms
&ldquo;tag-rag and bobtail.&rdquo; Such slang abounds in his book, and

<p class="par first">It does not follow from the proved existence of
mystery-dramas in pagan cults in the Roman empire in the first century,
<span class="sc">C.E.</span>, that the Jesuists had a similar usage;
but when we find in the New Testament an express reference to such
parallelism, and in the early Fathers a knowledge that such parallels
were drawn, we are entitled to ask whether there is not further
evidence. When &ldquo;Paul&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2645src"
href="#xd23e2645" name="xd23e2645src">1</a> tells his adherents:
&ldquo;Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of
daimons:<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2650src" href="#xd23e2650" name=
"xd23e2650src">2</a> ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord and of
the table of daimons,&rdquo; he is complaining that some converts are
wont to partake indifferently of the pagan and Christian sacraments.
Few students now, probably, will assent to the view that the
&ldquo;tables of daimons,&rdquo; with their similar rites, were sudden
imitations of the Christian sacraments. They were of old standing. But
the Jesuist rite also was in all likelihood much older, in some form,
than the Christian era.</p>
<p class="par">If there is any principle of comparative mythology that
might fairly have been claimed as generally accepted by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>experts
a generation ago, it is that &ldquo;the ritual is older than the myth:
the myth derives from the ritual, not the ritual from the
myth.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2660src" href="#xd23e2660"
name="xd23e2660src">3</a> This principle, expressly posited by himself
as by others before him, Sir James Frazer resolutely puts aside when he
comes to deal with the Christian mythus. Disinterested science cannot
assent to such a course.</p>
<p class="par">That there were &ldquo;tables&rdquo; in the cults of
many Gods is quite certain: temple-meals for devotees seem to have been
normal in Greek religion;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2670src" href=
"#xd23e2670" name="xd23e2670src">4</a> and in the cults of the
Saviour-Gods there were special collocations of sacramental meals with
&ldquo;mysteries.&rdquo; In particular, apart from the famous
Eleusinian mysteries there were customary dramatic representations of
the sufferings and death of the God in the cults of Osiris, Adonis,
Attis, and Dionysos: in addition to a scenic representation of the
death of Herakles; and a special system of symbolic presentation of the
life of the God in the rites of initiation of the worship of
Mithra.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2688src" href="#xd23e2688" name=
"xd23e2688src">5</a> It is not to be supposed that these religious
representations amounted to anything like a complete drama, such as
those of the great Attic theatre. Rather they represented early stages
in the evolution which ended in Greek drama as we know it. Nearer
analogues are to be found in the religious plays of various savage
races in our own time.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2702src" href=
"#xd23e2702" name="xd23e2702src">6</a> What the mystery-plays in
general seem to have amounted to was a simple representation of the
life and death of the God, with a sacramental meal.</p>
<p class="par">The common objection to the hypothesis even of an
elementary mystery-play in the pre-gospel stages of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>Jesuism
is that Hebrew literature shows no dramatic element, the Jews being
averse from this as from other artistic developments of religious
instinct. To this we reply, first, that the mystery-play, as
distinguished from the primary sacrament, may or may not have been
definitely Jewish at the outset; and that the drama as seen developed
in the supplement to the gospels is certainly manipulated by Gentile
hands. But the objection is in any case invalid, overlooking as it
does:</p>
<p class="par">1. The essentially dramatic character of the Song of
Solomon.</p>
<p class="par">2. The partly dramatic character of the Book of Job.</p>
<p class="par">3. The dramatic form of the celebration of Purim.</p>
<p class="par">4. The existence in the Hellenistic period of theatres
at Damascus, C&aelig;sarea, Gadara, Jericho and Scythopolis, the first
two being, as we learn from Josephus, built by Herod the Great.</p>
<p class="par">5. The chronic pressure of Hellenistic culture influence
upon Jewish culture for centuries.</p>
<p class="par">6. The prevalence of Greek culture influence at the city
of Samaria, Damascus, Gaza, Scythopolis, Gadara, Panias (C&aelig;sarea
Philippi).</p>
<p class="par">7. The &ldquo;half-heathen&rdquo; character of the
districts of Trachonitis, Batanea, and Auranitis, east of the Lake of
Gennesareth.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2728src" href="#xd23e2728"

&ldquo;heathen&rdquo; territory.</p>

classes and the common people of the provinces.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par">9. The &ldquo;resuscitation of obsolete mysteries&rdquo;

symbolic sacrifices of atonement.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2749src"

<p class="par">10. The actual production of dramatic Greek poetry on

<p class="par">The eighth item needs to be specially insisted upon. It
is frequently asserted that nothing in the nature of a heteroclite cult
could subsist continuously in Jewry; that there were no religious ideas
in the Jewish world save those of the Sacred Books of the
Rabbis.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2766src" href="#xd23e2766" name=
"xd23e2766src">11</a> This is a historical delusion. The historical and
prophetic books of the Old Testament affirm a constant resort to pagan
rites and Gods before the Exile. There is official record of bitter
strife and sunderance between those of the Return and the people they
found on the soil. Malachi sounds the note of strife, lamenting popular
lukewarmness, sacrilege and unbelief. The simple fact that after the
Exile Hebrew was no longer the common language, and that the people
spoke Aramaic or &ldquo;Chaldee,&rdquo; tells of a highly artificial
relation between hierarchy and populace. Never can even Jud&aelig;a
have been long homogeneous. &ldquo;Neither in Galilee nor Per&aelig;a
must we conceive of the Jewish element as pure and unmixed. In the
shifting course of history Jews and Gentiles had been here so often,
and in such a variety of ways, thrown together, that the attainment of
exclusive predominance by the Jewish element must be counted among the
impossibilities. It was only in Jud&aelig;a that this was at least
approximately arrived at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href=
"#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>by the energetic agency of the
scribes during the course of a century.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e2771src" href="#xd23e2771" name="xd23e2771src">12</a></p>
<p class="par">The assumption commonly made is that all Jews and
&ldquo;naturalized&rdquo; Jews were of one theistic way of thinking,
like orthodox Christians, and, like these, could not imagine any other
point of view. If for that entirely one-sided conception the inquirer
will even substitute one in terms of the mixed realities of life in
Christendom he will be much nearer the truth. Over and above the
hatreds between sects and factions holding by the same formulas and
Sacred Books, there were in Jewry the innovators, then as now: the
minds which varied from the documentary norm in all directions,

Adventists, Mormons, and so on, who from a more or less common basis
radiated to all the points of the compass of creed. What faces us in
the rise of Christianity is the development of one of those variants,
on lines of adaptation to popular need, with an organization on lines
already tested in the experience of Judaism.</p>
<p class="par">Among the common cravings of the age was the need for a
<i>near</i> God,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2781src" href="#xd23e2781"
name="xd23e2781src">13</a> one ostensibly more in touch with human
sorrows and sufferings than the remote Supreme God. For the earlier
Hebrews, Yahweh was a tribal God like Moloch or Chemosh, fighting for
his people (when they deserved it) like other tribal Gods; a magnified
man who talked familiarly with Abraham and Sarah, and wrestled with
Jacob.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2787src" href="#xd23e2787" name=
"xd23e2787src">14</a> Even then, the attractions of other cults set up
constant resort to them by many Yahwists, unless <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>the
historical Sacred Books are as illusory upon this as upon other topics.
To say nothing of the continual charges against Jewish kings, from
Solomon downwards, of setting up alien worships, and the express
assertion of Jeremiah<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2798src" href=
"#xd23e2798" name="xd23e2798src">15</a> that in Judah there were as
many Gods as cities, and in Jerusalem as many Baal altars as streets,
we have the equally explicit assertion in Ezekiel<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e2804src" href="#xd23e2804" name="xd23e2804src">16</a> that
&ldquo;women weeping for Tammuz&rdquo; were to be seen in or at the
Temple itself. Now, Tammuz was a Semitic deity, borrowed, it would
seem, from the Akkadians,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2809src" href=
"#xd23e2809" name="xd23e2809src">17</a> an original or variant of
Adonis, the very type of the Saviour-God we are now tracing. Tammuz,
like Jesus, was &ldquo;the only-begotten son.&rdquo; If it be argued
that the worship of Tammuz must have disappeared during or after the
Exile, since it would not be tolerated in the Second Temple, the answer
is that Saint Jerome expressly declares that in his day the pagans
celebrated the worship of Tammuz at the very cave in which Jesus was
said to have been born at Bethlehem<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2814src"
href="#xd23e2814" name="xd23e2814src">18</a>&mdash;a detail of some
significance in our inquiry. Tammuz = Adonis = &ldquo;the Lord.&rdquo;
That worship, indeed, might conceivably be a revival occurring after
the fall of Jerusalem; but to say that there can have been no folklore
about Tammuz in Jewry or Galilee or Samaria between the time of Ezekiel
and that of Jerome would be to make an utterly unwarranted assertion.
The belief may even have survived under another God-name.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">[Among the many obscurations of history set up by
presuppositions is that which rules out all evidence for community of
source in myths save that of philology, the most precarious of all
proofs. The argument on this subject has been conducted even by
opposing schools of philology as if all alike believed that every God,
like every man, is an entity with a name, traceable by his name,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>and remaining substantially unchanged in his
attributes through the ages. When Max M&uuml;ller propounded such
derivations as that of <i>Zeus</i> from the Sanskrit <i>Dyaus</i>, some
scholars for whom Sanskrit was occult matter observed a respectful
deference, while others debated whether the derivations were
philologically sound. To mythological science, strictly speaking, it
mattered little whether they were or were not. God-ideas may pass with
little change from race to race through contacts of conquest, the
attached God-names changing alike for &ldquo;absorbed&rdquo; races and
for those which &ldquo;absorb&rdquo; them, whereas other God-names may
endure with little change for ages while the attributes connected with
them are being continuously modified, and the tales told under them are
being perpetually added to, and many are dismissed. The Zeus of the
Iliad is probably a wholly disparate conceptual figure from the Dyaus
of the early &ldquo;Aryan,&rdquo; supposing the names to be at bottom
the same vocable. The philological fact is one thing, the mythological
fact another.</p>
<p class="par">Writers like Dr. Conybeare, who have never even realized
the nature of a mythological problem, bewilder their readers by
blusterously affirming that there can be no homogeneity between
myth-conceptions unless the names attached to them in different regions
and by different races are etymologically akin. They irrationally ask
for linguistic &ldquo;equations&rdquo; where a linguistic equation by
itself would count for nothing, the relevant fact being the equation of
the myth-concepts. Blind to the salient facts that every
&ldquo;race&rdquo; concerned had undergone mutation by conquest; that
God-names and God-ideas alike passed from race to race by
intermarriages,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2832src" href="#xd23e2832"
name="xd23e2832src">19</a> by the effects of enslavement, and by

"xd23e2842src">21</a> they in effect assume that God-names and
God-concepts are fixed entities, traceable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>solely
by glossology. As if glossology could possibly pretend to trace, even
on its own ground, all the transformations of proper-names and
appellatives through different races and languages. The pretence that
these are on all fours with the general development of language is mere
scientific charlatanism.</p>
<p class="par">What mythology has to consider is the filiation and
interconnection of myth-concepts. This is so pervading a process that
even Max M&uuml;ller, after denying that there could have been any
&ldquo;crossing&rdquo; between Vedic and alien lines of thought in
respect of the closely similar Babylonian fire-cult and that of Agni,
consented to identify the Indian Soma, God of Wine, with the Moon-God
Chandra.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2851src" href="#xd23e2851" name=
"xd23e2851src">22</a> The transmutations of a cognate myth-concept
under the names of Dionysos (who has a hundred other epithets) and of
the Latin Liber, constitute a mythological process which philology
cannot elucidate. The scientifically traceable facts are the prevalence
and translation of such concepts as Wine-God, Sun-God, War-God,
Moon-God, Love-Goddess, Mother Goddess, Babe-God, through many races
and regions. One myth-factor of great importance, unrecognized by many
who dogmatize on such problems, is that of the influence of
sculpture,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2856src" href="#xd23e2856" name=
"xd23e2856src">23</a> through which such figures as that of the
Mother-Goddess become common property for many lands, setting up
community of belief on one line irrespective of prevailing theologies.
And it is quite certain that as the nations came to know more and more
of each other&rsquo;s Gods they borrowed traits and tales, thus
assimilating the general concepts attached to wholly different
names.</p>
<p class="par">Seeing, then, further, that, as in the case of Yahweh,
it was often a point of religious taboo that a deity should not be
called by &ldquo;his real name,&rdquo; and that nearly all had many
epithets, there was no limit to the interaction and mutation of cults
and God-norms. The exact derivation and history of the worship of
Tammuz in Jewry no one can pretend to know; and no one therefore can
pretend to know that it was not interlinked with other cults of names
associated with sets of attributes, rites, and tales. In view
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>of the idle declamation on the subject, it seems
positively necessary to remind the reader that even if he believes in
the historicity of Jesus he is not therefore entitled to assume the
historicity of Tammuz-Dumzi-Adonis, or Myrrha, or Miriam, or Joshua;
and that if he recognizes any connection, in terms of attributes,
between the God-concepts Mars and Ar&ecirc;s, or Zeus and Jupiter, or
Aphrodit&ecirc; and Venus, or Artemis and Diana, and does not in these
cases fall back upon the nugatory thesis of &ldquo;two different
deities,&rdquo; he is not entitled to do so over the suggestion that
one popular Syrian cult of a Lord-name may have connected with another.
There is really need here for a little critical vigilance, not to say
psychological analysis.]</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Even if we assume the earlier Jewish cult of Tammuz to
have been swept away in the Captivity, the new conditions would tend to
stimulate similar popular cults. When, after the Exile, the conception
of Yahweh began under Perso-Babylonian influences to alter in the
direction of a universalist theism, the common tendency to seek a
nearer God was bound to come into play. There is no more universal
feature in religious history than the recession of the High
Gods.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2871src" href="#xd23e2871" name=
"xd23e2871src">24</a> The more &ldquo;supreme&rdquo; a deity becomes,
in popular religion, the more generally does popular devotion tend to
elicit Son-Gods or Goddesses who seem more likely to be &ldquo;hearers
and answerers of prayer.&rdquo; Sacred Books certainly tend to check
such a reversion; and in Islam the check has been successful in virtue
of the very fact that Allah, like the early Yahweh, is in effect
conceived as a <i>racial</i> God, or God of a single cult. But the
tendency is seen at work all over the earth.</p>
<p class="par">The vogue of Apollo, of Dionysos, of Herakles, of
Tammuz-Adonis, of Krishna, of Buddha, of Balder, of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc;,
of the Virgin Mary, of the countless deities propitiated by savage
peoples who ignore their Supreme Gods, are all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>testimonies to the natural craving of religious
ignorance for a near God. The same craving certainly subsisted among
the Hebrews in so far as it was not completely laid by organized
legalism. And seeing that the redactors of the Sacred Books had
actually reduced many early deities&mdash;Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Daoud
= David, Moses, Joshua, and Samson&mdash;to the status of patriarchs
and heroes,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2884src" href="#xd23e2884" name=
"xd23e2884src">25</a> the craving would among some be relatively
strengthened. Jews who in time of trouble chronically reverted to alien
Gods and alien rites, even as did the Greeks and Romans, could not
conceivably fail altogether to adopt or cherish cults analogous to
those of Dionysos, Adonis, Osiris, so popular among the neighbouring
peoples.</p>
<p class="par">The hypothesis forced upon us by the whole history,
then, is that there had subsisted in Jewry, in original connection with
a sacrificial rite of Jesus the Son of the Father, a Sacrament of a
Hero-God Jesus, whose Name was strong to save. If it took the form of a
Sacrament of Twelve, with the ritual-representative of the God, it
would be closely analogous to the traditional Sacrament of Twelve in
which Aaron [the Anointed One = Messiah] and the [twelve] elders of
Israel &ldquo;ate bread with Moses&rsquo; father-in-law before
God.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2895src" href="#xd23e2895" name=
"xd23e2895src">26</a> Behind that narrative lies a ritual
<i>practice</i>. A sacrament of bread and wine is further indicated in
the mention of the mythic Melchisedek, &ldquo;King of Peace&rdquo; and
priest of &ldquo;El Elyon,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2903src"
href="#xd23e2903" name="xd23e2903src">27</a> &ldquo;without father and
without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days or
end of life, but made like unto the Son of God,&rdquo; who thus became
for Christists a type of Jesus.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2911src"
href="#xd23e2911" name="xd23e2911src">28</a> A sacramental banquet of
twelve seems to have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82"
name="pb82">82</a>]</span>been involved in the sacrificial ritual of
the Temple itself, where a presiding priest and twelve others daily
officiated.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2925src" href="#xd23e2925" name=
"xd23e2925src">29</a></p>
<p class="par">That Galilean or other Jews or semi-Jews, always in a
partly hostile relation to priests, scribes, and Pharisees, should in
an age of chronic war, disaster and revolution, maintain an old private
sacrament, with a subordinate worship of a Hero-God Jesus whose body
and blood had once literally and now symbolically brought salvation, is
not an unlikely but a likely hypothesis. The gospels themselves
indicate an attitude of demotic hostility alike to the king, the
priests, the scribes, the Pharisees, and the Sadducees. It is not
pretended that before and apart from Jesus there was no such hostility,
and that he generated it by his teaching. In a united community such
hostility could not be so generated. It was there to start with. If
then cults of Dionysos and Attis and Adonis, the annually dying and
suffering demigods, could openly subsist in the Hellenistic world
alongside of the State cults of Zeus and the other chief Gods, a secret
cult of a Hero-God Jesus could subsist in some part of Jewry, with its
survivals of rural paganism and its many contacts and mixtures with
Samaritan schism and Hellenistic culture. Yet further, if the popular
needs of the Hellenistic world could elicit and maintain a multitude of
private religious associations, each with its own sacramental
meal,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2932src" href="#xd23e2932" name=
"xd23e2932src">30</a> the same needs could elicit and maintain them
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="par">To this thesis it is objected that we have no mention of
the existence of a Jesus cult of any kind in the Hebrew books. But that
is a necessity of the case. The Sacred Books would naturally exclude
all mention of a cult which in effect meant the continued deification
of Joshua,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2942src" href="#xd23e2942" name=
"xd23e2942src">31</a> who had long been reduced to the status of a mere
hero in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=

personage has long been established by modern criticism.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e2950src" href="#xd23e2950" name=
"xd23e2950src">32</a> That he did not do what he is said in the Book of
Joshua to have done is agreed by all the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; critics.
Who or what then was Joshua? He is in many respects the myth-duplicate
of Moses, whose work he repeats, passing the Jordan as did Moses the
Red Sea, appointing his twelve, &ldquo;renewing&rdquo; the rite of
circumcision, and writing the law upon stones. But he notably excels
Moses in that he causes the sun and moon to stand still by his
word;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e2955src" href="#xd23e2955" name=
"xd23e2955src">33</a> and as this is cited from &ldquo;Jasher,&rdquo;
he is possibly the older figure of the two.</p>
<p class="par">And for the Jews he retained a special status. In his
Book he is made (with a &ldquo;thus saith the Lord&rdquo;) to give a
list of the conquests effected by him against &ldquo;the Amorite, and
the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite,
the Hivite, and the Jebusite.&rdquo; In <a class="biblink xd23e43"

the <i>Nous</i> of Plotinus. The eminent Talmudic scholar, Emmanuel
Deutsch, surmised that the Metatron is &ldquo;most probably nothing but

Counsel&rdquo; and Judge, there is perhaps ground for some such
surmise. It may have been, indeed, that the redactors of the sacred
books originally meant to <i>substitute</i> the Angel for Joshua in the
esteem of the people, giving the former the credit for the exploits of
the latter; but such a manipulation would be in itself a confession of
Joshua&rsquo;s renown. And in the Samaritan Targums &ldquo;the Angel of
God&rdquo; commonly stood for the divine names Jehovah and
Elohim.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3008src" href="#xd23e3008" name=

cue for the gospel-makers. And in the Jewish New Year liturgy, to this

<p class="par first">[To this inductive argument the only answer, thus
far, seems to be to argue, as does Dr. Conybeare, that while &ldquo;no
one nowadays accepts the Book of Joshua offhand as sound
history,&rdquo; nevertheless Joshua is <i>there</i> &ldquo;a man of
flesh and blood.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3118src" href=
"#xd23e3118" name="xd23e3118src">43</a> On the same reasoning, Samson
cannot be an Evemerized deity, though his mythical character is clear
to every mythologist. Such considerations our amateur meets by alleging
that if &ldquo;half-a-dozen or more&rdquo; men &ldquo;come along&rdquo;
mistaking an &ldquo;astral myth&rdquo; for a man, we should
&ldquo;think we were bewitched, and take to our heels.&rdquo;<a class=

"xd23e3123src">44</a> In this connection Dr. Conybeare represents me as
declaring Jesus to be &ldquo;an astral myth.&rdquo; It is not clear
whether Dr. Conybeare, who supposes totems to be Gods, knows what
&ldquo;astral myth&rdquo; means, so I impute rather hallucination than
fabrication. The rational reader is aware that no such theory has been
put or suggested by me.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3128src" href=
"#xd23e3128" name="xd23e3128src">45</a> But as to his thesis, which
would seem to imply that even solar deities could never be supposed by
&ldquo;half-a-dozen&rdquo; to be real men, it is sufficient to point
out that Herakles, the typical solar Hero-God, was believed by millions
in antiquity to be a real man; and that Samson, obviously = the Semitic
Shamas or Shimshai, a variant of Herakles, was believed by millions of
Jews to have been a real man. It is needless here to go into the cases
of Achilles and Ulysses; but the reader who would know more of
mythology than has been discovered by Dr. Conybeare and his newspaper
reviewers may usefully investigate these themes.</p>
<p class="par">As to Joshua, Dr. Conybeare, attempting academic humour,
argues (p. 17) that if the hero is &ldquo;interested in fruitfulness
and foreskins&rdquo; he ought to be conceived as a &ldquo;Priapic
god.&rdquo; The humorist, who pronounces his antagonists &ldquo;too
modest,&rdquo; seems to be unaware that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>Yahweh had the interests
in question. Becoming &ldquo;serious,&rdquo; he argues (p. 30) that
&ldquo;even if there ever existed such a cult, it had long vanished
when the book of Joshua was compiled.&rdquo; For other purposes, he
resorts (p. 16) to the test, &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Vanished,&rdquo; for Dr. Conybeare, means, &ldquo;is not
mentioned in the canonical Hebrew books.&rdquo; With his simple
conceptions of the religious life of antiquity, he supposes himself to
be aware of all that went on, religiously, in the lives of the
much-mixed population of Palestine. His statement (p. 31) that
&ldquo;<i>the</i> Jews&rdquo; in the fifth century <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> &ldquo;no longer revered David and Joshua and Joseph
as sun-gods&rdquo; is as relevant as would be the statement that they
did not worship Zeus. No one ever said that &ldquo;<i>the</i>
Jews&rdquo; carried on all their primitive cults in the post-exilic
period: the proposition is the expression of mere inability to conceive
the issue.</p>
<p class="par">When, on the other hand, Dr. Conybeare proceeds to
notice the thesis that the ancient Jesuine sacrament would presumably
survive as a secret rite, he disposes of the proposition by calling it
&ldquo;a literary trick.&rdquo; That would be a mild term for his
express assertion (p. 34) that I have claimed that &ldquo;the canonical
Book of Joshua originally contained&rdquo; the tradition that Joshua
was the son of Miriam&mdash;an explicit untruth. My reference to
deletions from the book expressly pointed to the theses of Winckler, a
scholar whom Dr. Conybeare supposes himself to discredit by expressions
of personal contempt. Winckler never put the hypothesis as to
Miriam.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3152src" href="#xd23e3152" name=

that &ldquo;they mark the first appearance in Semitic history of the
tendency to found religious societies on voluntary association and
mystic initiation.&rdquo; To the &ldquo;first&rdquo; I cannot
subscribe, save on a special construction of &ldquo;appearance.&rdquo;
But Robertson Smith&rsquo;s proposition was founded on the documentary
evidence; and when he writes that &ldquo;the obscure rites described by
the prophets have a vastly greater importance than has been commonly
recognized,&rdquo; with the addendum that &ldquo;everywhere the old
national Gods had shown themselves powerless to resist the gods of
Assyria and Babylon,&rdquo; we are listening to a great Semitic
scholar, an anthropologist, and a thinker, not to a &ldquo;wilful
child,&rdquo; as Dr. Conybeare may charitably be described, in words
which, after his manner of polemic, he applies to me.]</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Finally, we have seen that a rite of &ldquo;Jesus the
Son,&rdquo; otherwise known as the &ldquo;Week of the Son,&rdquo; was
actually specified by the Talmudists of the period of the fall of the
Temple. Taken with the item of the name Jesus Barabbas, &ldquo;Jesus
the Son of the Father,&rdquo; and the five-days&rsquo; duration of the
ritual of the sacrificed Mock-King, it completes a body of
<i>Jewish</i> evidence for the pre-Christian currency of the name Jesus
as a cult-name of some kind. It is now possible to see at once the
force of the primary thesis of Professor W. B. Smith<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e3177src" href="#xd23e3177" name="xd23e3177src">47</a> that the

Jesus-worshippers, albeit in small numbers, wherever he went.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=

<p class="par">To suppose that this could mean a far-reaching and
successful propaganda by &ldquo;the Twelve&rdquo; in the short period
represented to have elapsed between the Crucifixion and the advent of
Paul is not merely to take as history, or summary of history, the
miracle of Pentecost, but to ignore the rest of the narrative. First we
are told (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208:1">viii, 1</a>)
that after the martyrdom of Stephen the Christists &ldquo;were all
scattered abroad throughout the regions of <i>Jud&aelig;a</i> and
<i>Samaria, except the apostles</i>.&rdquo; It is only to Samaria that
Philip goes at that stage, and his doings are on the face of them
mythical. Yet Saul on his conversion finds the &ldquo;disciple&rdquo;
Ananias at Damascus. Then Peter &ldquo;went throughout all parts&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:32">ix,
32</a>), reaching Lydda, where <i>he</i> finds &ldquo;saints&rdquo;;
and then it is that &ldquo;<i>the apostles and the brethren that were
in Jud&aelig;a</i> heard that the Gentiles also had received the word
of God&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2011:1">xi, 1</a>).
It is after this that &ldquo;they that were scattered abroad upon the
tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled <i>as far as
Ph&oelig;nicia and Cyprus and Antioch</i>, speaking the word to none
save only to Jews. But there were some of them, <i>men of Cyprus and
Cyrene</i>, who when they were come to Antioch spake unto the Greeks
[<i>or</i> Grecian Jews] also, preaching the Lord Jesus&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%209:19">xi,
19</a>). Already there is an <i>ecclesia</i> at Antioch (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:1">xiii, 1</a>)
with nothing to account for its existence.</p>
<p class="par">At this stage it is represented that Saul and Barnabas
customarily preach Jesuism in the Jewish synagogues; and that only
after &ldquo;contradiction&rdquo; from jealous Jews at Antioch of
Pisidia do they &ldquo;turn to the Gentiles&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2013:46">xiii,
46</a>), continuing, however, to visit synagogues, till the Jewish
hostility becomes overwhelming. At Jerusalem, meanwhile, after all the
gospel invective against the Pharisees, there are found &ldquo;certain
of the sect of the Pharisees who believed,&rdquo; and who stand firm
for circumcision. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90"
name="pb90">90</a>]</span>Ere long we find at Ephesus the Alexandrian
Jew Apollos, who &ldquo;taught carefully the things concerning Jesus,
<i>knowing only the baptism of John</i>,&rdquo; having been
&ldquo;orally instructed in the way of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2018:25">xviii,
25</a>), but had to be taught &ldquo;more carefully&rdquo; by Priscilla
and Aquila. Then he passes on to Corinth. Paul in turn (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019">xix</a>) shows
at Ephesus, where he finds other early Jesuists, that they of the
baptism of John, though by implication they held that &ldquo;Jesus was
the Christ,&rdquo; had not received &ldquo;the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; which
went only with the baptism of Jesus&mdash;the baptism which only the
fourth gospel alleges (with contradictions), the synoptics knowing
nothing of any baptism <i>by</i> Jesus or the disciples; and only
Matthew and Mark even alleging that after resurrection he prescribed
it. In all this the hypnotized believer sees no untruth. To the eye of
reason there is revealed a process of primitive cult-building.</p>
<p class="par">In whatever direction we turn, we thus find in the
Jesuist documents themselves the traces of a
&ldquo;pre-Christian&rdquo; Jesuism and Christism. At Ephesus, the
believers &ldquo;were in all about twelve men&rdquo;&mdash;the number
required for the primitive rite. The subsequent statement (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2019:9-10">xix,
9&ndash;10</a>) that after Paul had debated daily for two years at
Ephesus &ldquo;all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord,
both Jews and Greeks,&rdquo; is typical of the method of the
pseudo-history. Either the whole narrative is baseless fiction or there
were prior developments of the Jesus-cult.</p>
<p class="par">It may be argued, indeed, that such a work of
manipulation as the <span class="sc">Acts</span> is no evidence for
anything, and that its accounts indicating a prior spread of Jesuism
are no more to be believed than its miracle stories. But however
fictitious be its accounts of any one person, it is certain that there
was a cult; and all critics are now <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91"
href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>agreed that the book is a
redaction of previous matter&mdash;probably of Acts of Paul, Acts of
Peter, Acts of the Apostles, and so on. And whereas the most
advantageous fiction from the point of view of the growing
&ldquo;catholic&rdquo; church would be an account of the apostles as
everywhere <i>making</i> converts, stories of their <i>finding</i> them
must be held to have been imposed on the redactor by his material.
There also it must be held to stand for some reality in the history of
the cult, for the same reason, that there was nothing to be gained by
inventing such a detail.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Still we are met by the objection that whatever
the Acts may say the gospels give no indication of any previous
Jesus-cult. But that is a position untenable for the biographical
school save by a temporary resort to the theory of myth-making. As
Professor W. B. Smith has pointed out, the gospels expressly represent
that the disciples healed the sick in the name of Jesus in places where
Jesus had never been. For the supernaturalists, that is only one more
set of miracles. But the biographical school, though it is much
inclined to credit Jesus with occult &ldquo;healing powers,&rdquo; can
hardly affirm such healing by means of a magic name, and has no
resource but to dismiss all such matter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3297src" href="#xd23e3297" name="xd23e3297src">49</a> Yet why
should the evangelists have framed such a narrative save on the
knowledge that the name of Jesus <i>was</i> a thing to conjure with in
Palestinian villages?</p>
<p class="par">It is true that the story is fully told only of the
mission of the Seventy. In Matthew the Twelve are &ldquo;sent&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>out but neither go nor return, for the narrative
continues with them present. In Mark and Luke, the Twelve go and return
without reporting anything, though Mark tells that they preached
repentance, cast out many devils, and healed many sick by anointing
them with oil. Evidently the mission was a heedless addition to the
older gospel or gospels: the third attempts to give it some
completeness. It is only the Seventy who make a report; and it is only
of them (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%2010:1">Lk. x, 1</a>)
that we are told they were to go to places &ldquo;whither he himself
was about to come.&rdquo; As the episode of the Seventy is in effect
given up as myth even by many supernaturalists (who feel that, if
historical, the episode could not have been overlooked in Matthew and
Mark), the biographical school are so far entitled to say that for them
the record does not posit a previously current Jesus-Name. But what
idea then do they connect with the sending-out of the Twelve, if not
the kind of idea that is associated with the sending-out of the
Seventy?</p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy feels &ldquo;authorized to believe&rdquo; (1)
that Jesus in some fashion chose twelve disciples and sent them out to
preach the simple &ldquo;evangel&rdquo; that &ldquo;the Kingdom of God
was at hand&rdquo;&mdash;that is, merely the evangel of John the
Baptist over again; and (2) that &ldquo;it seems&rdquo; that they went
two by two in the Galilean villages, and were &ldquo;well received:
their warning was listened to: sick persons were presented to them to
heal, <i>and there were cures</i>.&rdquo; To say this is to say, if
anything, that for the first Christians the Name of Jesus was held to
have healing power before his deification, and that it was a known
name.</p>
<p class="par">But we have stronger documentary grounds than these. The
Apocalypse is now by advanced critics in general recognized to have
been primarily a <i>Judaic</i>, not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"
href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>a Christian document.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e3325src" href="#xd23e3325" name=
"xd23e3325src">50</a> The critics apparently do not realize that this
verdict carries in it the pronouncement that Jesus was probably a
divine name for some section of the Jews before the rise of the
Christian cult. The twelve apostles enter only in an
interpolation:<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3330src" href="#xd23e3330"
name="xd23e3330src">51</a> in the main document we have the &ldquo;four
and twenty elders&rdquo; of an older cult,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3335src" href="#xd23e3335" name="xd23e3335src">52</a> answering
to the twenty-four Counsellor Gods of Babylonia. Even if we assign the
book to a &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; writer of the earliest years, at the
very beginning of the Pauline mission,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3341src" href="#xd23e3341" name="xd23e3341src">53</a> we are
committed to connecting the cult at that stage with the doctrine of the
Logos,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3350src" href="#xd23e3350" name=
"xd23e3350src">54</a> with the Alpha and Omega, and with the Mithraic
or Babylonian lore of the Seven Spirits. Of the gospel story there is
no trace beyond the mention of slaying: on the other hand the Child-God
of the dragon-story is wholly non-Christian, and derives from
Babylon.</p>
<p class="par">The entire book, in short, raises the question whether
the Jesus-cult may not have come in originally (as so much of Judaism
did), or been reinforced, from the side of Babylon, down even to the
name of Nazareth, since there was a Babylonian <i>Nasrah</i>. As
Samaria, the seat of the special celebration of Joshua, is historically
known to have been colonised from Assyria and Babylon, the
possibilities are wide. Suffice it that the Apocalypse indicates a
strong Babylonian element in some of the earliest real documentary
matter we have in connection with the Jesuist cult in the New
Testament; and at the same time makes certain the pre-Gospel currency
of a Jesus-cult among professed Jews.</p>
<p class="par">Yet another clue obtrudes itself in the Epistle of
Jude&mdash;or, as it ought to be named, Judas&mdash;a document notably
Jewish in literary colour. Mr. Whittaker<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3365src" href="#xd23e3365" name="xd23e3365src">55</a> was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>the first of the myth-theorists to lay proper
stress on the fact that the reading &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; (= Joshua) in
verse 5,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3372src" href="#xd23e3372" name=
"xd23e3372src">56</a> alone makes the passage intelligible:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Now I desire to put you in remembrance, though ye
know all things once for all, how that Jesus [that is, Joshua, instead
of &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;] having saved a people out of the land of
Egypt <i>the second time</i><a class="noteref" id="xd23e3380src" href=
"#xd23e3380" name="xd23e3380src">57</a> [Moses having saved them the
first time], destroyed them that believed not. And angels which kept
not their own principality, but left their proper habitation, he hath
kept in everlasting bonds under darkness unto the judgement of the
great day.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The reference is certainly to Joshua, who is here
quasi-deified. Plainly, as Mr. Whittaker observes, &ldquo;the binding
of erring angels can only be attributed to a supernatural being, and
not to a mere national hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And, as Mr. Whittaker also notes, we have yet another
clear indication from the Jewish-Christian side that Joshua in Jewish
theology had a heavenly status. In the &ldquo;Sibylline Oracles&rdquo;
there occurs the passage:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Now a certain excellent man shall come again from
heaven, <i>who spread forth his hands upon the very fruitful tree, the
best of the Hebrews, who once made the sun stand still</i>, speaking
with beauteous words and pure lips.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3407src"
href="#xd23e3407" name="xd23e3407src">58</a></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The identification of Christ with Joshua,&rdquo;
remarks the orthodox translator cited, &ldquo;is a mixture of Jewish
and Christian legend (<i>sic</i>) which is unique. It is no question of
symbolism here, as Joshua in Christian writings is treated as a type of
Christ, but rather the confusion is such as might be made by an
ignorant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>person reading, <a class="biblink xd23e43" title=

8</a>, &lsquo;if Jesus had given them rest,&rsquo; and concluding that
Jesus Christ led the Jews into Canaan. <i>The author, indeed,
identifies himself with the Jews</i>, as where he prays (vers. 327
ff.): &lsquo;Spare Judea, Almighty Father, that we may see thy
judgments&rsquo;; and were it credible that the whole book was the work
of one author, we should regard his religion as syncretic, and in full
accord neither with law nor gospel. But the book ... is of composite
character. One writer may have been a Christian; another filches
occasionally from Christian sources, but has no lively faith in Christ:
like many of his countrymen at this time, he suspends his judgment, and
instead of making a decision expends his energies in denunciation of
the hated power of Rome, and in speculations concerning the
future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It matters not whether the writer was or was not a
confident Christian: Judaic by upbringing or tuition he certainly was;
and his identification of Jesus the Christ with Joshua is one more of
the proofs that for many Jews Joshua had a quasi-divine status, as was
fitting for a personage who &ldquo;made the sun stand still.&rdquo;
Taken collectively, the proofs cannot be overridden or explained away.
Joshua was for the Jews of the Hellenistic period the actual founder of
the rite of circumcision:<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3428src" href=
"#xd23e3428" name="xd23e3428src">59</a> that is to say, mythologically,
he was the God of the rite. But still more weighty is the evidence that
his name lived on as that of the God-victim of a kindred rite; and it
is on that basis that there was founded the rite which is for
Christianity what circumcision had been for Judaism. Circumcision is a
rite of redemption, the giving of a symbolic part of the body to
&ldquo;redeem&rdquo; the whole&mdash;a surrogate for the Passover
sacrifice of the first-born, developed into a racial theocratic rite.
It is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>significant that the Saviour-God of this rite
becomes the Saviour-God of the rite offered in place of that of the
Passover, whereby the primordial human sacrifice is re-typified in that
of the deity who once for all dies for all. It is upon such roots of
pre-historic religion that the world-religions grow.</p>

Mystery-Drama</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That there was an actual mystery-drama behind the
gospel tragedy is revealed by the document itself, which is
demonstrably not primarily a narrative at all, but a drama transcribed,
with a minimum of necessary elucidation. Only the habit of reading with
uncritical reverence can conceal from a student the dramatic bareness
and brevity of the record in the synoptics&mdash;a record which in the
fourth gospel is grafted, without any real development, on a protracted
discourse that only artificially suggests circumstantial reality.
Chapter xiii is as it were inserted in the middle of that discourse;
and chapter xiv proceeds as from the end of chapter xii. The original
document cannot have had the story of the tragedy in this form. At the
close of chapter xiv the &ldquo;Arise, let us go hence,&rdquo; is a
slight artifice to suggest action where there is none. Only at chapter
xviii is the action resumed; and it is as bare and formal as in the
synoptics. Broadly speaking, the action is something superadded. A long
discourse has been wrapped round the first section, but without
altering its compressed character. The synoptics know nothing of the
Johannine discourses: the Johannine document knows no more of a
historic episode than do the synoptics: it can only invent
monologues.</p>
<p class="par">Reading the synoptic account, we find a series of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>separate <i>scenes</i>, with the barest possible
explanatory connection and introduction. The treason of Judas, in
itself a myth,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3451src" href="#xd23e3451"
name="xd23e3451src">60</a> is announced beforehand in three sentences,
with no sign of reflection on the meaninglessness of the situation
posited. A mystico-mythical episode of a message from the Master to one
who is to prepare the passover meal comes next. In Matthew the message
is to &ldquo;such a man&rdquo;&mdash;undescribed: in Mark, a man
carrying a pitcher of water is to be seen and followed, and
&ldquo;where<i>soever</i> he shall enter in&rdquo; the message is to be
delivered to &ldquo;the goodman of the house,&rdquo; and the room will
be shown ready. To read biography in this, or to ascribe a
&ldquo;primitive&rdquo; trustworthiness to the Marcan story, is to cast
out criticism.</p>
<p class="par">But the Supper itself is presented with the same
ceremonial effect; the whole content being the mention of the betrayal
and the dogmatic meaning of the ritual. In Mark, the whole episode of
the Supper occupies eight sentences: in Matthew, where Judas puts his
question and gets his answer, ten. After the singing of a hymn, the
scene changes instantly to the Mount of Olives. No reason is assigned
for the going out into the night: it is taken for granted that the
Divine One is <i>going to his death</i>, of his own will and prevision.
Either we believe this, making him a God, or we recognize a myth.
Biography it cannot be. And drama it clearly is.</p>
<p class="par">On the Mount, there is another brief dialogue,
committing Peter and the other disciples&mdash;a wholly hostile
presentment. Again the scene changes to Gethsemane, where the three
selected disciples with whom Jesus withdraws actually sleep while he
utters the prayer set down. There was thus no one to hear it. Any
biographical theory which is concerned to respect verisimilitude
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>must here recognize something else than narrative,
and will presumably posit invention. But why should invention take this
peculiar form? If the object was to impeach the disciples&mdash;and
they certainly are impeached&mdash;is it not an impossibly crude device
to <i>tell</i> of their sleeping throughout the prayer and its
repetition, leaving open the retort: &ldquo;You report the words of the
prayer: from whom did you get them if not from those disciples, who
must have heard them?&rdquo; But if we suppose the scene first
presented <i>dramatically</i>, no perplexity or counter-sense is
involved. The impeachment is effectual; the episode is <i>seen</i>; and
no one is concerned, in presence of a drama, to ask how certain words
came to be known to have been spoken by any personage. It is the
reduction to narrative form that betrays the dramatic source. And when
we find in both Matthew and Mark, which clearly embody the same
original document, this sequence:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">And again he came, and found them sleeping ... and
they wist not <i>what to answer him</i> [nothing has been said]. And he
cometh the third time, and saith unto them, <i>Sleep on now, and take
your rest: it is enough; the hour is come</i>: behold, the son of man
is betrayed.... <i>Arise now</i> ...,</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">the documentary crux, which the biographical school
makes vainly violent attempts to solve, is at once solved when we
realize that in the transcription two speeches have accidentally been
combined. The drama must have gone thus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first"><i>The disciples still asleep.</i></p>
<p class="par"><i>Enter</i> Jesus.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Jes.</i> Sleep on now and take your rest.
[<i>Exit.</i></p>
<p class="par"><i>Enter</i> Jesus. (<i>Disciples still asleep.</i>)</p>
<p class="par"><i>Jes.</i> It is enough: the hour is come, etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The transcriber, missing an <i>exit</i> and an
<i>enter</i>, has simply run two speeches together; and the gospel
copyists have faithfully followed their copy, putting &ldquo;they wist
not what to answer him&rdquo; in the wrong place. In an original
narrative the combination could not happen. In the transcription of the
copy of a play it could easily happen. We find instances in the
printing of the plays of Shakespeare and other early dramatists.</p>

<p class="par">Where is the difficulty? It is precisely in drama, and
in drama alone, that the impossible narrative <i>can</i> pass as
possible. Action on the stage is always telescoped: time is always more
or less ignored, because the selected action must go on continuously.
Again and again in Shakespeare (or rather in pseudo-Shakespeare) we
find irrelevant and futile scenes interposed to create the
<i>semblance</i> of a time interval; but in <span class=
"sc">Othello</span> and <span class="sc">Measure for Measure</span>, to
name no other plays, the action is impossibly telescoped. The
explanation is that in the psychology of the theatre time is
disregarded, save by the most critical. The simple-minded audience of
devotees which witnessed the Christist mystery-play would never ask
&ldquo;How <i>did</i> they hunt up those witnesses in Jerusalem at
midnight?&rdquo; <i lang="la">Solvitur ambulando</i>, so to speak: they
<i>saw the trial</i>. It is when the play is transmuted to dead
narrative, wherein a number of questions and answers are reduced to a
few bald statements, that the impossibility obtrudes itself.</p>
<p class="par">Our critic defies us to explain how such a trial came to
be put in a drama. It is hard to see why he is puzzled. The general
object of the whole tragedy is to show Jesus as the victim, first, of
the priests, elders, and scribes&mdash;the Jewish ecclesiastical order,
whose hostility to Jesus is a constant datum of the gospels. <i>At this
stage</i> the mystery-play has become a Gentile-Christian performance,
in which even the Jewish disciples play a poor part, while the official
class are the mainspring of the tragedy. How could the priests be more
effectively impeached than by exhibiting them as producing plainly
suborned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>evidence to convict Jesus? Lord Tennyson, in our
time, put a bad freethinker in a bad play to discredit freethinking.
And he had non-canonical as well as canonical precedents. The
apocryphal &ldquo;Acts of Pilate&rdquo; appears to follow a drama in
which a great many gospel episodes were dramatized as well as the
trial.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3652src" href="#xd23e3652" name=
"xd23e3652src">62</a></p>
<p class="par">As for the critic&rsquo;s assertion that a midnight
search for witnesses is not posited in the narrative, it is again
impossible to follow his reasoning. If the <span class="trans" title=
"ez&#275;toun ... martyrian"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7952;&zeta;&#8053;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu; ...
&mu;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&upsilon;&rho;&#8055;&alpha;&nu;</span></span> of
Mark means &ldquo;sifted evidence,&rdquo; the <span class="trans"
title="ez&#275;toun pseudomartyrian"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7952;&zeta;&#8053;&tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;
&psi;&epsilon;&upsilon;&delta;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&upsilon;&rho;&#8055;&alpha;&nu;</span></span>
of Matthew means &ldquo;sifted false evidence.&rdquo; The theory of
&ldquo;sifting&rdquo; is impossible. I have had the curiosity to
examine ten translations&mdash;Latin, German, modern Greek, Italian,
French, and English, without finding that one translator has ever
dreamt of it. All agree with the current English rendering, which means
<i>sought</i> [false] <i>testimony</i>, because no other rendering is
possible. The record goes on, in Mark:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">... and found <i>it</i> [<i>i. e.</i> the required
evidence] not. <i>For many bare false witness against him</i> and their
witness agreed not together. <i>And there stood up certain</i>, and
bare false witness against him.... And not even so did their witness
agree together. And the high priest <i>stood up</i>....</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">According to the new theory, the prosecution
&ldquo;sifted evidence&rdquo; which &ldquo;stood up,&rdquo; as did the
high priest.</p>
<p class="par">Defending his thesis, the exegete argues<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e3705src" href="#xd23e3705" name=
"xd23e3705src">63</a> that the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; was not written
but oral; that is to say, the authorities had collected witnesses
during the day and had then kept them till midnight or later without
ascertaining what evidence they were able to give. The narratives
neither say nor hint anything of the kind; whereas if such had been
supposed to be the fact it would have been the natural thing to say
so.</p>
<p class="par">But the thing alleged is unnatural. On the one hand we
are asked to believe that the authorities had before sunset collected a
number of witnesses, when they could not have any certainty of making
the arrest; on the other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>hand we are to believe that with
all this extraordinary fore-planning they had not taken the normal
precaution of ascertaining what the witnesses could say. In the
transcribed drama as it stands, the authorities are represented as
knaves; in the interpretation before us, framed to save the credit of
the narrative, they are represented as childishly foolish. The
narrative as we have it defies its vindicators. It tells that witnesses
were <i>sent for</i>; and only in a drama, in which time-conditions are
ignored, could such a fiction have been resorted to.] #/</p>
<p class="par">The story is equally dramatic to the close. Everything
is scenic, detached, episodic: it is left to Luke (who elaborates the
Supper scene; gives a positive command of Jesus for the future
celebration where the previous documents merely show the rite as it was
practised; puts the denial of Peter before the trial; and <i>drops the
whole procedure of the witnesses</i>) to interpose the episode of the
daughters of Jerusalem between the Roman trial and the crucifixion; and
even that is parenthetic and dramatic, as are the burial and the
seeking; whereafter, in Mark, the gospel abruptly ends. The rest is
supplementary documentation. How much of <i>that</i> may have been
dramatized, it is impossible to say. That there had been evolution in
the mystery-play is involved in our conception of it. It began with the
simple Sacrament, at a remote period, the Sacrament itself being
evolved from a primitive and savage to a symbolic form, the God being
probably first represented, as in kindred rites,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3725src" href="#xd23e3725" name="xd23e3725src">64</a> by his
sacrificial priest; and later by the victim.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3736src" href="#xd23e3736" name="xd23e3736src">65</a> It is after
the primitive and localized cult seeks the status of a world-religion
that the ritual developes into a quasi-history; and we can see
conflicting influences in that. One writer causes Jesus to be buffeted
and mocked at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>the Jewish trial, as if to counterbalance the
derision in the Roman trial; even as Luke interposes a third trial
before Herod, to make sure that the guilt should ultimately lie with
the Jewish government. In the action as in the doctrine, the Gentile
influence finally predominates.</p>
<p class="par">The important point to note in the documentary evolution
is that the mystery-play remained a secret representation for some time
after written gospels were current. To begin with, all the
mystery-plays of the age were on the same footing of secrecy. What
takes place finally in the Jesuist cult is a simple adding-on of the
mystery-play to the gospels. It was not for nothing that the school of
B. Weiss, seeking to expiscate a &ldquo;Primitive Gospel&rdquo; from
the synoptics, made it end before the Tragedy. This was what they were
bound to do by their documentary tests; and the common objection that
such an ending is very improbable&mdash;a difficulty avowed by Weiss
and weakly sought to be solved by some of the school&mdash;is seen in
the light of the myth-theory to be a difficulty only for those who
assume not merely the historicity of a Jesus but the historicity of the
whole tragedy story down to the resurrection. Once it is realized that
that story is a dramatic development of an originally simple myth of
sacrificial death, the documentary difficulty disappears.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">[It should not be necessary to point out the
absolute falsity of the assertion of Dr. Conybeare (<i>Histor.
Christ</i>, p. 49) that in my theory &ldquo;The Christian
<i>Gospels</i> ... are a transcript of the annually performed ritual
drama, just as Lamb&rsquo;s <i>Tales from Shakespeare</i> are
transcripts of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.&rdquo; In <i>Pagan
Christs</i> (p. 201) it is expressly argued that &ldquo;the Mystery
Play is an addition to a previously existing document.... The
transcriber has been able to add to the previous gospel the matter of
the mystery-play; and there he loyally stops.&rdquo; And <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>it
is repeatedly pointed out that the transcription has been made with the
minimum of necessary narrative connection. Thus the parallel with
Lamb&rsquo;s <i>Tales</i> is false even as regards the matter posited
as constituting the play; while the assertion that the whole of the
gospel is represented as a transcription of a play is pure fabrication.
And this mere falsification of the theory passes with traditionalist
critics as a confutation.]</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Some account, indeed, the Jesuists must have given of
the death of their God or Son-God when they reached the stage of
systematic propaganda; and this was in all likelihood a bare statement
such as we have in the Epistles, that he was put to a humiliating death
and rose again. It is very likely that accounts of the manner of the
death varied in the first written accounts, as they certainly would in
the traditions or rituals current at various points; and we may grant
to the documentary critics that various versions may have attached to
early forms or sources of Mark and Matthew. A general statement that
Jesus was the &ldquo;Son of the Father,&rdquo; and that he had been put
to death with ignominy, would elicit, as has been above argued, the
objection that &ldquo;Jesus Barabbas&rdquo; was certainly no divine
personage. The Barabbas story, then, explaining away that objection, is
a comparatively late development, of which, accordingly, we find not a
single trace in the Acts or the Epistles. But similarly the Supper is
not described in the Acts or the Epistles apart from the plainly
interpolated account in First Corinthians. And at the outset the Supper
would be emphatically secret matter, not to be written down.</p>
<p class="par">Whatever conclusion, then, was given to the earlier
gospel or gospels, it did not include that. As little would it give the
Agony, or the trials before the Sanhedrim and before Pilate, throwing
the guilt of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105"
name="pb105">105</a>]</span>tragedy on the Jews, or the episodes
disparaging the apostles. Judas is in all likelihood primarily a figure
of a Gentile form of the play, being just <i>Judaios</i>, a
Jew,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3782src" href="#xd23e3782" name=
"xd23e3782src">66</a> created by Gentile or Samaritan animus. What
inferribly happened was a dramatic development, by Gentile hands, of a
primarily simple mystery drama, consisting of the Supper, the death,
and the resurrection, into the play as it now stands transcribed in the
synoptics, with the Betrayal, the Agony, the Denial, the Trials, and
the dramatic touches in the crucifixion scene.</p>
<p class="par">The school of Weiss, then, on our theory, reached by
comparatively consistent methods of documentary criticism a relatively
sound conclusion. The earlier forms of the gospel certainly had not the
<i>present</i> conclusion; and whatever simple conclusions they had
were bound to be superseded when the complete mystery play was
transcribed&mdash;the very transcription being a reason for their
disappearance. At some point, probably by reason of the Christian
reaction against all pagan procedure, the play, which in its present
form must always have been special to a town or towns, was dropped, and
though the tendency was to keep the Eucharist an advanced rite for
initiates, and withhold it from catechumens,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3798src" href="#xd23e3798" name="xd23e3798src">67</a> the
reduction of the Tragedy to narrative form became a necessity for
purposes of propaganda. Without it, the gospels were inadequate to
their purposes; and it supplied the needed confutation of the charge
that Jesus was simply a victim in the Barabbas rite. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This said, we have still to face the main problem of the
evolution of the Jesus-cult into a world-religion in which the God
Sacrificed <i>to</i> the God becomes also the Messiah of the Jews and
the Teacher of those who believe in him. And the tracing of that
evolution must obviously be difficult. The process of extracting true
out of false history is always so; and where the concocted history and
its contingent literature are the main documents, we can in the nature
of things reach only general conceptions. But general conceptions are
attainable; and we must frame them as scientifically as we can.

Samaritans have a late book ascribing to him many feats not given in
the Jewish records. Concerning this Professor Drews wrote (<i>Christ
Myth</i>, p. 57, <i>note</i>):&mdash;&ldquo;The Samaritan Book of
Joshua (Chronicon Samaritanum, published 1848) was written in Arabic
during the thirteenth century in Egypt, and is based upon an old work
compiled in the third century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>&rdquo; Dr.
Conybeare (<i>Hist. Christ</i>, p. 33) declares the last statement to
be &ldquo;founded on pure ignorance,&rdquo; adding: &ldquo;<i>and</i>
the <i lang="la"><span class="corr" id="xd23e3035" title=
"Source: Encyclopaedia">Encyclop&aelig;dia</span> Biblica</i> declares
it to be a medieval production of no value to anyone except the student
of the Samaritan sect under Moslem rule.&rdquo; Be it observed (1) that
Dr. Drews <i>had actually described</i> the book as a medieval
production; (2), that his whole point was that it was legendary, not
historical; and (3) that the <i>Ency. Bib.</i> article, which bears out
both propositions, uses no such language as Dr. Conybeare ascribes to
it after the word &ldquo;production,&rdquo; and says <i>nothing
whatever</i> on the hypothesis that the book is founded on a
compilation of the third century <i>B.C.</i> That hypothesis, framed by
Hebraists, is one upon which Dr. Conybeare has not the slightest right
to an opinion. Dr. A. E. Cowley, in the <i>Encyc. Brit.</i>, describes
the book as derived from &ldquo;sources of various dates.&rdquo; That
being so, Dr. Conybeare, who as usual has wholly failed to understand
what he is attacking, has never touched the position, which is that
Joshua legends so flourished among the Samaritans that they are
preserved in a medieval book&mdash;unless he means to allege that the
legends are of medieval <i>invention</i>, a proposition which, indeed,
would fitly consummate his excursion.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

such matters, ascribes the Joshua theory (<i>Hist. Christ</i>, pp. 32,
35) and the special hypothesis that Joshua was mythically the son of
Miriam, to Professor Smith, who never broached either. His pretext is a
passage in the preface to the second edition of <i>Christianity and
Mythology</i>, which he perverts in defiance of the context. On this
basis he proceeds to charge &ldquo;imitation.&rdquo; Aspersion in Dr.
Conybeare&rsquo;s polemic is usually thus independent of

from Niemojewski, without endorsing it, an &ldquo;astral&rdquo; theory
of Jesus and Pilate. Dr. Conybeare appears incapable of giving a true
account of anything he antagonizes, whether in politics or in religion.
Elsewhere Drews speaks of astral <i>elements</i> in the Christ story;
but so do those adherents of the biographical school who recognize the

another point (p. 87, <i>note</i>) Dr. Conybeare triumphantly cites
Winckler as saying that &ldquo;the humanization of the Joshua myth was
complete when the book of Joshua was compiled.&rdquo; This grants the
whole case. &ldquo;Humanization&rdquo; tells of previous deity; and
just as Achilles remained a God after being presented in the Iliad,
Joshua was &ldquo;human&rdquo; only for those whose sole lore

<i>C.M.</i> 354. I find that Volkmar (there cited) had in one of his
later works put the theory that the traitor, whom he held to be an
invention of the later Paulinists, would be named <i>Juda</i> as
typifying Judaism. The myth-theory is not necessarily committed to the
whole of this thesis, but the objections of Brandt (<i lang="de">Die

reasons on the presupposition of a central historicity, and argues as

<p class="par first">Professor W. B. Smith, whose brilliant,
independent, and powerful advocacy of the myth-theory has brought
conviction to readers not otherwise attracted by it, has stressed two
propositions in regard to the evolution of the Jesus-cult. One is that
the movement was &ldquo;multifocal,&rdquo; starting from a number of
points;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3829src" href="#xd23e3829" name=
"xd23e3829src">1</a> the other that the essential and inspiring motive
was the monotheistic conception, as against all forms of polytheism;
Jesus being <i>conceived</i> as &ldquo;the One God.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e3842src" href="#xd23e3842" name="xd23e3842src">2</a>
That the first proposition is sound and highly important, I am
convinced. But after weighing the second with a full sense of the
acumen that guides all Professor Smith&rsquo;s constructive
speculation, I remain of the opinion that it needs considerable
modification.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3856src" href="#xd23e3856"
name="xd23e3856src">3</a> In clearing up these two issues, we shall go
a long way towards establishing a clear theory of the whole historical
process.</p>
<p class="par">In the first place, a &ldquo;multifocal&rdquo; movement,
a growth from many points, is involved in all our knowledge of the
highly important matters of the history of the early Christian sects,
and the non-canonical Christian documents. Perhaps the proposition is
even more widely true than <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>Professor Smith indicates. To
begin with, we find at an early stage the sects of (1) Ebionites and
(2) Nazarenes or Nazareans, in addition to (3 and 4) the Judaizing and
Gentilizing movements associated with &ldquo;the Twelve&rdquo; and Paul
respectively; and yet further (5) the movement associated with the name
of Apollos. Further we have to note (6) the Jesuism of the Apocalypse,
partly extra-Judaic in its derivation; and (7) that of the ninth
section of the <span class="sc">Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</span>,
which emerges as a quasi-Ebionitic addition to a purely Judaic
document&mdash;not yet interpolated by the seventh section. Yet
further, we have (8) the factors accruing to the religious epithet
&ldquo;Chr&#275;stos&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3869src" href=
"#xd23e3869" name="xd23e3869src">4</a> (= good, gracious), which
specially attached to the underworld Gods of the Samothracian
mysteries; also to Hermes, Osiris, and Isis; and (9 and 10) the
Christist cult-movements connected with the non-Jesuine <span class=
"sc">Pastor</span> of Hermas and the sect of the Eleesaites.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e3879src" href="#xd23e3879" name="xd23e3879src">5</a>
And this is not an exhaustive list.</p>
<p class="par">(11) That there was a general Jewish ferment of
Messianism on foot in the first century is part of the case of the
biographical school. That there actually arose in the first and second
centuries various Jewish &ldquo;Christs&rdquo; is also a historical
datum. But the biographical school are not wont in this connection to
avow the inference that alone can properly be drawn from the phrase of
Suetonius as to a movement of Jewish revolt at Rome occurring in the
reign of Claudius <i lang="la">impulsore Chresto</i>, &ldquo;(one)

written, <i>Chrestos</i> (preserved in the French <i lang=

speculations that exclude all semblance of human personality. All the
evidence points for its origination to abstract or general conceptions,
not to any actual life or teaching. It spins its doctrinal web from
within.</p>
<p class="par">(13) And it is not merely on the Jewish side that we
have evidence of elements in the early Jesuist movement which derive
from sources alien to the gospel record. M. Loisy<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e3977src" href="#xd23e3977" name="xd23e3977src">16</a> admits that

Jesus appeals to the Father to let him descend to earth and reveal the
mysteries to men, &ldquo;has an extraordinary resemblance to the
dialogue between the God Ea and his son Marduk in certain Babylonian
incantations.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e3987src" href=
"#xd23e3987" name="xd23e3987src">18</a> He disposes of the problem by
claiming that before it can weigh with us &ldquo;it must be proved that
the hymn of the Ophites is anterior to all connection of their sect
with Christianity.&rdquo; The implication is that Gnostic syncretism
could add Babylonian traits to the Jewish Jesus. But when we find
signal marks of a Babylonian connection for the name Jesus in the
Apocalypse we cannot thus discount, without further evidence, the
Babylonian connection set up by the Naassene hymn. Nor can the
defenders of a record which they themselves admit to contain a mass of
unhistorical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>matter claim to have a ground upon which they
can dismiss as a copyist&rsquo;s blunder the formula in which in an old

name="xd23e3995src">19</a> The very gospel records present the name of
Jesus as one of magical power in places where he has not appeared. A
strict criticism is bound to admit that the whole question of the
pre-Christian vogue of the name Jesus presents an unsolved problem.</p>
<p class="par">There are further two quasi-historical Jesuses, one (14)
given in the Old Testament, the other (15) in the Talmud, concerning
which we can neither affirm nor deny that they were connected with a
Jesuine movement before the Christian era. One is the Jesus of
Zechariah (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zec%203:1-8">iii,
1&ndash;8</a>; <a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zec%204:11-15">vi,
11&ndash;15</a>); the other is the Jesus Ben Pandira, otherwise Jesus
Ben Satda or Stada, of the Talmud. The former, Jesus the High Priest,
plays a quasi-Messianic part, being described as &ldquo;The
Branch&rdquo; and doubly crowned as priest and king. The word for
&ldquo;branch&rdquo; in Zechariah is <i>tsemach</i>, but this was by
the pre-Christian Jews identified with the <i>netzer</i> of <a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2011:1">Isaiah xi,
1</a>; which for some the early Jesuists would seem to have constituted
the explanation of Jesus&rsquo; cognomen of &ldquo;Nazarite&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Nazar&aelig;an.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4016src" href=
"#xd23e4016" name="xd23e4016src">20</a> The historic significance of
the allusions in Zechariah appears to have been wholly lost; and that
very circumstance suggests some pre-Christian connection between the
name Jesus and a Messianic movement, which the Jewish teachers would be
disposed to let slip from history, and the Christists who might know of
it would not wish to recall. But the matter remains an enigma.</p>
<p class="par">Equally unsolved, thus far, is the problem of the
Talmudic Jesus. Ostensibly, there are two; and yet both seem to have
been connected, in the Jewish mind, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>the Jesus of the
gospels. One, Jesus son of Pandira, is recorded to have been stoned to
death and then hanged on a tree, for blasphemy or other religious
crime, on the eve of a Passover in the reign of Alexander Jann&aelig;us
(<span class="sc">B.C.</span> 106&ndash;79).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4030src" href="#xd23e4030" name="xd23e4030src">21</a> But in the
Babylonian Gemara he is identified with a Jesus Ben Sotada or Stada or
Sadta or Sidta, who by one rather doubtful clue is put in the period of
Rabbi Akiba in the second century <span class="sc">C.E.</span> He too
is said to have been stoned and hanged on the eve of a Passover, but at
Lydda, whereas Ben Pandira is said to have been executed at Jerusalem.
Some scholars take the unlikely view that two different Jesuses were
thus stoned and hanged on the eve of a Passover: others infer one,
whose date has been confused.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4038src" href=
"#xd23e4038" name="xd23e4038src">22</a> As Ben Pandira entered into the
Jewish anti-Christian tradition, and is posited by the Jew of Celsus in
the second century, the presumption is in favour of his date. His
mother is in one place named Mariam Magdala = &ldquo;Mary the
nurse&rdquo; or &ldquo;hair-dresser&rdquo;&mdash;a quasi-mythical
detail. But even supposing him to have been a real personage, whose
name may have been connected with a Messianic movement (he is said to
have had five disciples), it is impossible to say what share his name
may have had in the Jesuine tradition. Our only practicable clues,
then, are those of the sects and movements enumerated.</p>
<p class="par">It soon becomes clear from a survey of these sects and
movements (1) that a cult of a <i>non</i>-divine Jesus, represented by
the Hebraic Ebionites, subsisted for a time alongside of one which,
also among Jews, made Jesus a supernatural being. Only on the basis of
an original <i>rite</i> can such divergences be explained. The
Ebionites come before us, in the account of Epiphanius, as using a form
of the Gospel of Matthew which lacked the first two <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>chapters (an addition of the second or third
century), denying the divinity of Jesus, and rejecting the apostleship
of Paul.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4053src" href="#xd23e4053" name=
"xd23e4053src">23</a> It is implied that they accepted the story of the
Last Supper and the Crucifixion. Here then were Jewish believers in a
<i>Hero</i>-Jesus, the <i>Servant</i> of God (as in the <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span>), not a <i>Son</i> of God in any supernatural
sense. Ebionism had rigidly restricted the cult to a subordinate
form.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, we have in the Nazarean sect or
fraternity a movement which added both directly and indirectly to the
Jesuist evolution. In the so-called Primitive Gospel, as expiscated by
the school of B. Weiss from the synoptics, there is <i>no</i> mention
of Nazareth, and neither the epithet &ldquo;Nazarene&rdquo; nor
&ldquo;Nazarite&rdquo; for Jesus. All three names are wholly absent
from the Epistles, as from the Apocalypse: Jesus never has a cognomen
after we pass the Acts. The inference is irresistible that first the
epithet &ldquo;Nazarean,&rdquo; and later the story about Nazareth,
were additions to a primary cult in which Jesus had no birth-location,
any more than he had human parents.</p>
<p class="par">I have suggested<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4080src"
href="#xd23e4080" name="xd23e4080src">24</a> that the term may have
come in from the Hebrew &ldquo;Netzer&rdquo; = &ldquo;the
branch,&rdquo; which would have a Messianic meaning for Jews. Professor
Smith, who makes a searching study of Hebrew word-elements, has
developed a highly important thesis to the effect that the word
<i>Nazaraios</i>, &ldquo;Nazarean,&rdquo; which gives the residual name
for the Jesuist sect in the Acts and the predominant name for Jesus in
the gospels (apart from Mark, which gives <i>Nazarenos</i>),<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4094src" href="#xd23e4094" name=
"xd23e4094src">25</a> is not only pre-Christian but old Semitic; that
the fundamental meaning of the name (<i>Nosri</i>) is
&ldquo;guard&rdquo; or &ldquo;watcher&rdquo; (= Saviour?), and that the
appellation is thus cognate with &ldquo;Jesus,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>which signifies Saviour.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4105src" href="#xd23e4105" name="xd23e4105src">26</a> On the
negative side, as against the conventional derivations from Nazareth,
the case is very strong. More than fifty years ago, the freethinker
Owen Meredith insisted on the lack of evidence that a Galilean village
named Nazareth existed before the Christian era. To-day; professional
scholarship has acquiesced, to such an extent that Dr. Cheyne<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4113src" href="#xd23e4113" name=
"xd23e4113src">27</a> and Wellhausen have agreed in deriving the name
from the regional name Gennesareth, thus making Nazareth = Galilee;
while Professor Burkitt, finding &ldquo;the ordinary view of Nazareth
wholly unproved and unsatisfactory,&rdquo; offers &ldquo;a desperate
conjecture&rdquo; to the effect that &ldquo;the city of Joseph and
Mary, the <span class="trans" title="patris"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&pi;&alpha;&tau;&rho;&#8055;&sigmaf;</span></span> of Jesus, was
Chorazin.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4126src" href="#xd23e4126"
name="xd23e4126src">28</a> In the face of this general surrender, we
are doubly entitled to deny that either the appellation for Jesus or
the sect-name had anything to do with the place-name Nazareth.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4132src" href="#xd23e4132" name=
"xd23e4132src">29</a></p>
<p class="par">That there was a Jewish sect of
&ldquo;Nazar&aelig;ans&rdquo; before the Christian era, Professor Smith
has clearly shown, may be taken as put beyond doubt by the testimony of
Epiphanius, which he exhaustively analyzes.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4140src" href="#xd23e4140" name="xd23e4140src">30</a> Primitively
orthodox, like the Samaritans, and recognizing ostensibly no Bible
personages later than Joshua, they appear to have merged in some way
with the &ldquo;Christians,&rdquo; who adopted their name, perhaps
turning &ldquo;Nazar&aelig;an&rdquo; into &ldquo;Nazorean.&rdquo; My
original theory was that the &ldquo;Nazar&aelig;ans&rdquo; were just
the &ldquo;Nazarites&rdquo; of the Old Testament&mdash;men
&ldquo;separated&rdquo; and &ldquo;under a vow&rdquo;;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4147src" href="#xd23e4147" name=
"xd23e4147src">31</a> and that the two movements somehow coalesced, the
place-name &ldquo;Nazareth&rdquo; being finally adopted to conceal the
facts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>But Professor Smith is convinced, from the
evidence of Epiphanius, that between &ldquo;Nazarites&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Nazar&aelig;ans&rdquo; there was no connection;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4154src" href="#xd23e4154" name=
"xd23e4154src">32</a> and for this there is the strong support of the
fact that the Jews cursed the Jesuist &ldquo;Nazor&aelig;ans&rdquo;
while apparently continuing to recognize the Nazirs or Nazarites. That
Professor Smith&rsquo;s derivation of the name may be the correct one,
I am well prepared to believe.</p>
<p class="par">But it is difficult to connect such a derivation of an
important section of the early Jesuist movement with the thesis that
Jesuism at its historic outset was essentially a monotheistic crusade.
On this side we seem to face an old sect for whom, as for the adherents
of the early sacrament, Jesus was a secondary or subordinate divine
personage. Standing at an early Hebraic standpoint, the Nazar&aelig;ans
would have no part in the monotheistic universalism of the later
prophets. The early Hebrews had believed in a Hebrew God, recognizing
that other peoples also had theirs. How or when had the Nazar&aelig;ans
transcended that standpoint?</p>
<p class="par">In the absence of any elucidation, the very ably argued
thesis of Professor Smith as to the name &ldquo;Nazar&aelig;an&rdquo;
seems broadly out of keeping with the thesis that a monotheistic
fervour was a main and primary element in the development of the
Christian cult; and that Jesus was conceived by his <i>Jewish</i>
devotees in general as &ldquo;the One God.&rdquo; This would have meant
the simple dethroning of Yahweh, a kind of procedure seen only in such
myths as that of Zeus and Saturn, where one racial cult superseded
another. But the main form of Christianity was always Yahwistic, even
when Paul in the Acts is made to proclaim to the Athenians an
&ldquo;unknown God&rdquo;&mdash;an idea really derived <i>from</i>
Athens. Only for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116"
name="pb116">116</a>]</span>a few, and these non-Jews, can &ldquo;the
Jesus&rdquo; originally have been the One God; unless in so far as the
use of the name &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; may for some unlettered Jews
have identified Jesus with Yahweh, who was so styled. The Ebionites
denied his divinity all along. The later Nazareans were Messianists who
did not any more than the Jews seem to conceive that the Messiah
<i>was</i> Yahweh.</p>
<p class="par">The whole doctrine of &ldquo;the Son&rdquo; was in
conflict with any purely monotheistic idea. Nowhere in the synoptics or
the Epistles is the Christ doctrine so stated as really to serve
monotheism: the &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; of the fourth
gospel is late; and the opening verses of that gospel show tampering,
telling of a vacillation as to whether the Logos was God or &ldquo;with
God&rdquo;&mdash;or rather &ldquo;next to God,&rdquo; in the strict
meaning of <span class="trans" title="pros"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&pi;&rho;&#8056;&sigmaf;</span></span>. Here we have a reflex of
Alexandrian philosophy,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4184src" href=
"#xd23e4184" name="xd23e4184src">33</a> not the evangel of the popular
cult. Formally monotheistic the cult always was, even when it had
become actually Trinitarian; and all along, doubtless, the
particularist monotheism of the Jews was at work against all other
God-names in particular and polytheism in general; but that cannot well
have been the moving force in a cult which was professedly beginning by
establishing an ostensibly new deity, and was ere long to make a
trinity.</p>
<p class="par">So far as anything can be clearly gathered from the
scattered polemic in the Talmud against &ldquo;the Minim,&rdquo; the
standing title for Jewish heretics, including Christians as
such,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4192src" href="#xd23e4192" name=
"xd23e4192src">34</a> they at least appear not as maintaining the
oneness of God but rather as affirming a second Deity,<a class=

"xd23e4200src">35</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=

of <span class="corr" id="xd23e4207" title="Source: thes econd">the
second</span> century. That the Jewish Rabbis took this view of their
doctrine is explained in terms of the actual theology of the Epistle to
the Hebrews. If there was any new doctrine of monotheism bound up with
Jesuism, it must have been outside of the Jewish sphere, where the
unity of God was the very ground on which Jesuism was resisted. As
such, the Jewish Christians did not even repudiate the Jewish law,
being expressly aspersed by the Rabbis as secret traitors who professed
to be Jews but held alien heresies.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4210src"
href="#xd23e4210" name="xd23e4210src">36</a></p>
<p class="par">I have said that &ldquo;the Jesus&rdquo; can have been
&ldquo;the one God&rdquo; only for non-Jews. Conceivably he may have
been so for some Samaritans. There is reason to believe that in the age
of the Herods only a minority of the Samaritan people held by
Judaism;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4215src" href="#xd23e4215" name=
"xd23e4215src">37</a> and there is Christian testimony that in the
second century a multitude of them worshipped as the One God Sem or
Semo, the Semitic Sun-God whose name is embodied in that of Samson.
Justin Martyr, himself a Samaritan, expressly alleges that
&ldquo;almost all the Samaritans, and a few even of other
nations&rdquo; worship and acknowledge as &ldquo;the first God&rdquo;
Simon, whom he describes as a native of Gitta or Gitton, emerging in
the reign of Claudius C&aelig;sar.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4221src"
href="#xd23e4221" name="xd23e4221src">38</a> Justin&rsquo;s gross

that he could believe in the deification of an alien as Supreme God, in
his lifetime, in a nation with ancient cults. The thing being
impossible, we are left to the datum that Sem or Semo or Sem-on =
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=

<p class="par">Returning to the subject of &ldquo;the magician
Simon&rdquo; in his <span class="sc">Dialogue with
Trypho</span>,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4238src" href="#xd23e4238"
name="xd23e4238src">41</a> Justin there repeats that the Samaritans
call him &ldquo;God above all power, and authority, and might.&rdquo;
Remembering that the Jewish Shema, &ldquo;the Name,&rdquo; is the
ordinary appellative for Yahweh, we note possibilities of syncretism as
to which we can only speculate. The fact that the Jews actually called
their God in general by a word meaning &ldquo;Name&rdquo; and also
equating with the commonest Semitic name for the Sun-God, while in
their sacred books they professedly transmuted the sacred name
(altering the consonants) to Adonai = Lord (&ldquo;plural of
majesty&rdquo;), the name of the Syrian God Adonis, is a circumstance
that has never been much considered by hierologists. It suggests that
the Samaritan Sem also may have been &ldquo;known&rdquo; by other
names; and the certain fact of the special commemoration of Joshua
among the Samaritan Judaists gives another ground for speculation. The
words of Jesus to the Samaritan woman in the fourth gospel, &ldquo;Ye
worship ye know not what,&rdquo; seem to signify that from the
Alexandrian-Jewish standpoint Samaritans worshipped a name only.</p>
<p class="par">What does emerge clearly is that Samaria played a
considerable part in the beginnings of Christism. In a curious passage
of the fourth gospel (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%208:48">viii, 48</a>)
the Jews say to Jesus, &ldquo;Say we not well that thou art a
Samaritan, and hast a daimon?&rdquo;: and he answers with a denial that
he has a daimon, but makes no answer on the other charge. The fact that
Matthew makes the Founder expressly forbid his disciples to enter any
city of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>Samaritans, while an interpolator of
Luke<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4248src" href="#xd23e4248" name=
"xd23e4248src">42</a> introduces the story of the good Samaritan to
counteract the doctrine, tells that there was a sunderance between
Samaritan and Judaizing Christists just as there was between the
Judaizers and the Gentilizers in general. From Samaria, then, came part
of the impulse to the whole Gentilizing movement; and the Samaritan
Justin shows the anti-Judaic animus clearly enough.</p>
<p class="par">That Samaritan Jesuism, then, may early have outgone the
Pauline in making Jesus &ldquo;the One God,&rdquo; in rivalry to the
Jewish Yahweh, is a recognizable possibility. But still we do not reach
the conception of a zealously monotheistic cult, relying specially on a
polemic of monotheism. Justin fights for monotheism as against
paganism, but on the ordinary Judaic-Christian basis. This is a later
polemic stage. Nor does the thesis of a new monotheism seem at all
essential to the rest of Professor Smith&rsquo;s conception of the
emergence of Jesuism. He agrees that it exfoliated from a scattered
cult of secret mysteries: the notion, then, that it was at the time of
its open emergence primarily a gospel of One God, and that God Jesus,
is ostensibly in excess of the first hypothesis. It is also somewhat
incongruous with the acceptance of the historic fact that it spread as
a <i>popular</i> religion, in a world which desired <i>Saviour</i>

"pb120">120</a>]</span>notion of them as zealous for an abstract and
philosophical conception of deity. Whether we take the epistles to the
Corinthians as genuine or as pseudepigraphic, they are clearly
addressed to a simple-minded community, not given to monotheistic
idealism, and indeed incapable of it.</p>
<p class="par">In positing, further, a rapid &ldquo;triumph&rdquo; of
Christism <i>in virtue of</i> its monotheism, Professor Smith seems to
me to outgo somewhat the historical facts. There is really no evidence
for any rapid triumph. Renan, after accepting as history the
pentecostal dithyramb of the Acts, came to see that no such
quasi-miraculous spread of the faith ever took place; and that the
Pauline epistles all presuppose not great churches but &ldquo;little
Bethels,&rdquo; or rather private conventicles, scattered through the
Eastern Empire.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4277src" href="#xd23e4277"
name="xd23e4277src">44</a> He justifiably doubted whether Paul&rsquo;s
converts, all told, amounted to over a thousand persons. At a much
later period, sixty years after Constantine&rsquo;s adoption of the
faith, the then ancient church of Antioch, the city where first the
Jesuists &ldquo;were called Christians,&rdquo; numbered only about a
fifth part of the population.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4286src" href=
"#xd23e4286" name="xd23e4286src">45</a> &ldquo;At the end of the second
century, probably not a hundredth part even of the central provinces of
the Roman Empire was Christianized, while the outlying provinces were
practically unaffected.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Rather we seem bound to infer that Christianity made
headway by assimilating pagan ideas and usages on a basis of Judaic
organization. It is ultimately organization that conserves cults; and
the vital factor in the Christian case is the adaptation of the model
set by the Jewish synagogues and their central supervision. Of course
even organization cannot avert brute conquest; and the organized pagan
cults in the towns of the Empire went down ultimately before Christian
violence as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121"
name="pb121">121</a>]</span>Christian went down before violence in
Persia in the age of the Sassanides. But Christian organization,
improving upon Jewish, with no adequate rivalry on the pagan side,
developed the situation in which Constantine saw fit to imperialize the
cultus, as the one best fitted to become that of the State.</p>
<p class="par">How then did the organization begin and grow? The data
point insistently to a special group in Jerusalem; and behind the myth
of the gospels we have historical and documentary ground for a
hypothesis which can account for that as for the other
myth-elements.</p>

of Josephus</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When we are considering the possibilities of
underlying historical elements in the gospel story, it may be well to
note on the one hand the entirely negative aspect of the works of
Josephus to that story, and on the other hand the emergence in his
writings of personages bearing the name Jesus. If the defenders of the
historicity of the gospel Jesus would really stand by Josephus as a
historian of Jewry in the first Christian century, they would have to
admit that he is the most destructive of all the witnesses against
them. It is not merely that the famous interpolated passage<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4308src" href="#xd23e4308" name=
"xd23e4308src">46</a> is flagrantly spurious in every aspect&mdash;in
its impossible context; its impossible language of semi-worship; its
&ldquo;He was (the) Christ&rdquo;; its assertion of the resurrection;
and its allusion to &ldquo;ten thousand other wonderful things&rdquo;
of which the historian gives no other hint&mdash;but that the flagrant
interpolation brings into deadly relief the absence of all mention of
the crucified Jesus and his sect where mention must have been made by
the historian if they had existed. If, to say nothing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>of
&ldquo;ten thousand wonderful things,&rdquo; there was <i>any</i>
movement of a Jesus of Nazareth with twelve disciples in the period of
Pilate, how came the historian to ignore it utterly? If, to say nothing
of the resurrection story, Jesus had been crucified by Pilate, how came
it that there is no hint of such an episode in connection with
Josephus&rsquo; account of the Samaritan tumult in the next chapter?
And if a belief in Jesus as a slain and returning Messiah had been long
on foot before the fall of the Temple, how comes it that Josephus says
nothing of it in connection with his full account of the expectation of
a coming Messiah at that point?</p>
<p class="par">By every test of loyal historiography, we are not merely
forced to reject the spurious passage as the most obvious interpolation
in all literature: we are bound to confess that the
&ldquo;<i>Silence</i> of Josephus,&rdquo; as is insisted by Professor
Smith,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4324src" href="#xd23e4324" name=
"xd23e4324src">47</a> is an insurmountable negation of the gospel
story. For that silence, no tenable reason can be given, on the
assumption of the general historicity of the gospels and Acts. Josephus
declares himself<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4331src" href="#xd23e4331"
name="xd23e4331src">48</a> to be in his fifty-sixth year in the
thirteenth year of Domitian. Then he was born about the year 38. By his
own account,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4337src" href="#xd23e4337"
name="xd23e4337src">49</a> he began at the age of sixteen to
&ldquo;make trial of the several sects that were among
us&rdquo;&mdash;the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes&mdash;and
in particular he spent three years with a hermit of the desert named
Banos, who wore no clothing save what grew on trees, used none save
wild food, and bathed himself daily and nightly for purity&rsquo;s
sake. Thereafter he returned to Jerusalem, and conformed to the sect of
the Pharisees. In the <span class="sc">Antiquities</span>,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4346src" href="#xd23e4346" name=
"xd23e4346src">50</a> after describing in detail the three sects before
named, he gives an account of a fourth &ldquo;sect of Jewish
philosophy,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>founded by Judas the Galilean, whose
adherents in general agree with the Pharisees, but are specially
devoted to liberty and declare God to be their only ruler, facing
torture and death rather than call any man lord.</p>
<p class="par">A careful criticism will recognize a difficulty as to
this section. In &sect; 2, as in the <span class="sc">Life</span>,
&ldquo;three sects&rdquo; are specified; and the concluding section has
the air of a late addition. Seeing, however, that the sect of Judas is
stated to have begun to give trouble in the procuratorship of Gessius
Florus, when Josephus was in his twenties, it is quite intelligible
that he should say nothing of it when naming the sects who existed in
his boyhood, and that he should treat it in a subsidiary way in his
fuller account of them in the <span class="sc">Antiquities</span>. It
is not so clear why he should in the first section of that chapter call
Judas &ldquo;a Gaulanite, of a city whose name was Gamala,&rdquo; and
in the final section call him &ldquo;Judas the Galilean.&rdquo; There
was a Gamala in Gaulanitis and another in Galilee. But the discrepancy
is soluble on the view that the sixth section was added some time after
the composition of the book. There seems no adequate ground for
counting it spurious.</p>
<p class="par">On what theory, then, are we to explain the total
silence of Josephus as to the existence of the sect of Jesus of
Nazareth, if there be any historical truth in the gospel story? It is
of no avail to suggest that he would ignore it by reason of his Judaic
hostility to Christism. He is hostile to the sect of Judas the
Galilean. There is nothing in all his work to suggest that he would
have omitted to name any noticeable sect with a definite and
outstanding doctrine because he disliked it. He seems much more likely,
in that case, to have described and disparaged or denounced it.</p>
<p class="par">And here emerges the hypothesis that he did disparage or
denounce the Christian sect in some passage which has been deleted by
Christian copyists, perhaps in the very <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>place now filled by
the spurious paragraph, where an account of Jesuism as a
<i>calamity</i> to Judaism would have been relevant in the context.
This suggestion is nearly as plausible as that of Chwolson, who would
reckon the existing paragraph a description of a Jewish calamity, is
absurd. And it is the possibility of this hypothesis that alone averts
an absolute verdict of non-historicity against the gospel story in
terms of the silence of Josephus. The biographical school may take
refuge, at this point, in the claim that the Christian forger, whose
passage was clearly unknown to Origen, <i>perhaps</i> eliminated by his
fraud a historic testimony to the historicity of Jesus, and also an
account of the sect of Nazar&aelig;ans.</p>
<p class="par">But that is all that can be claimed. The fact remains
that in the <span class="sc">Life</span>, telling of his youthful
search for a satisfactory sect, Josephus says not a word of the
existence of that of the crucified Jesus; that he nowhere breathes a
word concerning the twelve apostles, or any of them, or of Paul; and
that there is no hint in any of the Fathers of even a hostile account
of Jesus by him in any of his works, though Origen makes much of the
allusion to James the Just,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4376src" href=
"#xd23e4376" name="xd23e4376src">51</a>&mdash;also dismissible as an
interpolation, like another to the same effect cited by Origen, but not
now extant.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4382src" href="#xd23e4382" name=
"xd23e4382src">52</a> There is therefore a strong negative presumption
to be set against even the forlorn hypothesis that the passage forged
in Josephus by a Christian scribe ousted one which gave a hostile
testimony.</p>
<p class="par">Over a generation ago, Mr. George Solomon of Kingston,
Jamaica, noting the general incompatibility of Josephus with the gospel
story and the unhistorical aspect of the latter, constructed an
interesting theory,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4389src" href=
"#xd23e4389" name="xd23e4389src">53</a> of which I <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>have
seen no discussion, but which merits notice here. It may be summarized
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">1. Banos is probably the historical original of the
gospel figure of John the Baptist.</p>
<p class="par">2. Josephus names and describes two Jesuses, who are
blended in the figure of the gospel Jesus: (<i>a</i>) the Jesus
(<span class="sc">Wars</span>, VI, v, 3) who predicts &ldquo;woe to
Jerusalem&rdquo;; is flogged till his bones show, but never utters a
cry; makes no reply when challenged; returns neither thanks for
kindness nor railing for railing; and is finally killed by a stone
projectile in the siege; and (<i>b</i>) Jesus the Galilean
(<span class="sc">Life</span>, &sect;&sect; 12, 27), son of Sapphias,
who opposes Josephus, is associated with Simon and John, and has a
following of &ldquo;sailors and poor people,&rdquo; one of whom betrays
him (&sect; 22), whereupon he is captured by a stratagem, his immediate
followers forsaking him and flying.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4412src"
href="#xd23e4412" name="xd23e4412src">54</a> Before this point,
Josephus has taken seventy of the Galileans with him (&sect; 14) as
hostages, and, making them his friends and companions on his journey,
sets them &ldquo;to judge causes.&rdquo; This is the hint for
Luke&rsquo;s story of the seventy disciples.</p>
<p class="par">3. The &ldquo;historical Jesus&rdquo; of the siege, who
is &ldquo;meek&rdquo; and venerated as a prophet and martyr, being
combined with the &ldquo;Mosaic Jesus&rdquo; of Galilee, a disciple of
Judas of Galilee, who resisted the Roman rule and helped to precipitate
the war, the memory of the &ldquo;sect&rdquo; of Judas the Gaulanite or
Galilean, who began the anti-Roman trouble, is also transmuted into a
myth of a sect of Jesus of Galilee, who has fishermen for disciples, is
followed by poor Galileans, is betrayed by one companion and deserted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>by the rest, and is represented finally as dying
under Pontius Pilate, though at that time there had been no Jesuine
movement.</p>
<p class="par">4. The Christian movement, thus mythically grounded,
grows up after the fall of the Temple. Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;the wrath is
come upon them to the uttermost&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd23e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%202:16">1 Thess.
ii, 16</a>) tells of the destruction of the Temple, as does <a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2012:24-28">Hebrews

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Heb%2013:12-14">xiii,
12&ndash;14</a>.</p>
<p class="tb"></p>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This theory of the construction of the myth out of
historical elements in Josephus is obviously speculative in a high
degree; and as the construction fails to account for either the central
rite or the central myth of the crucifixion it must be pronounced
inadequate to the data. On the other hand, the author developes the
negative case from the silence of Josephus as to the gospel Jesus with
an irresistible force; and though none of his solutions is founded-on
in the constructive theory now elaborated, it may be that some of them
are partly valid. The fact that he confuses Jesus the robber captain
who was betrayed, and whose companions deserted him, with Jesus the
&ldquo;Mosaic&rdquo; magistrate of Tiberias, who was followed by
sailors and poor people, and was &ldquo;an innovator beyond everybody
else,&rdquo; does not exclude the argument that traits of one or the
other, or of the Jesus of the siege, may have entered into the gospel
mosaic.</p>

the Twelve Apostles</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">All careful investigators have been perplexed by
the manner of the introduction of &ldquo;the Twelve&rdquo; in the
gospels; and they would have been still more so if they had realized
the total absence of any reason in the texts for the creation of
disciples or apostles at all. Disciples to learn&mdash;what? Apostles
to teach&mdash;what? The choosing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127"
href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>is as plainly mythical as the
function. In Mark (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%201:16">i, 16</a>) and
Matthew (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:18">iv, 18</a>),
Jesus calls upon the brothers Simon and Andrew to leave their fishing
and &ldquo;become fishers of men.&rdquo; They come at the word; and
immediately afterwards the brothers James and John do the same. There
is no pretence of previous teaching: it is the act of the God.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4452src" href="#xd23e4452" name=
"xd23e4452src">55</a> In Matthew, at the calling of the apostle Matthew
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%209:9">ix,
9</a>), who in Mark (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%202:14">ii, 14</a>)
becomes Levi the son of Alph&aelig;us, the procedure is the same:
&ldquo;Follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then, with no connective development whatever, we
proceed at one stroke to the full number.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4464src" href="#xd23e4464" name="xd23e4464src">56</a> Matthew
actually makes the mission of the twelve the point of choosing, saying
simply (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2010:1">x, 1</a>):
&ldquo;And he called unto him <i>his</i> twelve disciples,&rdquo;
adding their names. In Mark (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%203:13">iii, 13</a>)
we have constructive myth:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth
unto him whom he himself would: and they went unto him. And he
appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send
them forth to preach, and to have authority to cast out devils.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">And the lists converge. Levi has now disappeared from
Mark&rsquo;s record, and we have instead &ldquo;<i>James</i> the son of
Alph&aelig;us,&rdquo; but with Matthew in also. The lists of the first
two synoptics have been harmonized. In Luke, where only three are at
first called, after a miracle (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%205:1-11">v,
1&ndash;11</a>), the twelve are also summarily chosen on a mountain;
and here the list varies: Levi, who has been separately called
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%205:27">v,
27</a>) as in Mark, disappears here also in favour of &ldquo;James of
Alph&aelig;us&rdquo;; but there is no Thadd&aelig;us, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>there are two Judases, one being &ldquo;of
James,&rdquo; which may mean either son or brother. And this Judas
remains on the list in the Acts. Candid criticism cannot affirm that we
have here the semblance of veridical biography. The calling of the
twelve has been <i>imposed upon</i> an earlier narrative, with an
arbitrary list, which is later varied. The calling of the fishermen, to
begin with, is a symbolical act, as is the calling of a tax-gatherer.
The calling of the twelve is a more complicated matter.</p>
<p class="par">In searching for the roots of a pre-Christian Jesus-cult
in Palestine, we have noted the probability that it centred in a rite
of twelve participants, with the &ldquo;Anointed One,&rdquo; the
representative of the God, and anciently the actual victim, as
celebrating priest. The Anointed One is &ldquo;the Christ&rdquo;; and
the Christ, on the hypothesis, is Jesus Son of the Father. The twelve,
as in the case of the early Jesus-cult at Ephesus, form as it were
&ldquo;the Church.&rdquo; A body of twelve, then, who might term
themselves &ldquo;Brethren of the Lord,&rdquo; may well have been one
of the starting-points of Jewish Jesuism.</p>
<p class="par">But the first two synoptics, clearly, started with a
group of only four disciples, to which a fifth was added; and in John
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%201:35-49">i,
35&ndash;49</a>) the five are made up at once, in a still more
supernatural manner than in the synoptics, two being taken from the
following of John the Baptist. Then, still more abruptly than in the
synoptics, we have the completion (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%206:70">vi,
70</a>):&mdash;&ldquo;Did not I choose you the twelve, and one of you
is a devil?&rdquo; It would be idle to say merely that the twelve are
suddenly imposed on the narrative, leaving a biographical five: the
five are just as evidently given unhistorically, for some special
reason, mythical or other.</p>
<p class="par">Now, though fives and fours and threes are all
quasi-sacred numbers in the Old Testament, it is noteworthy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>that in one of the Talmudic allusions to Jesus
Ben-Stada he is declared to have had five disciples&mdash;Matthai,
Nakai or Neqai, Nezer or Netzer, Boni or Buni, <i>and also</i> Thoda,
all of whom are ostensibly though not explicitly described as having
been put to death.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4516src" href=
"#xd23e4516" name="xd23e4516src">57</a> As this passage points to the
Jesus who is otherwise indicated as post-Christian, it cannot
critically be taken as other than a reference to a current Christian
list of five, though it may conceivably have been a miscarrying
reference to the Jesus of the reign of Alexander Jann&aelig;us. In any
case, it is aimed at a set of five; and there is never any Talmudic
mention of a twelve. If, then, the Talmudic passage was framed by way
of a stroke against the Christians it must have been made at a time
when the list of twelve had not been imposed on the gospels. Further,
it is to be noted that it provides for a Matthew, and perhaps for a
&ldquo;Mark,&rdquo; the name &ldquo;Nakai&rdquo; being put next to
Matthew&rsquo;s; while in Boni and Netzer we have ostensible founders
for the Ebionites and Nazar&aelig;ans. Finally, Thoda looks like the
native form of Thadd&aelig;us; though it might perhaps stand for the
Theudas of <a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205:36">Acts v,
36</a>. Seeing how names are juggled with in the official list and in
the MS. variants (&ldquo;Lebb&aelig;us whose surname was
Thadd&aelig;us&rdquo; stood in the Authorised Version, on the strength
of the Codex Bezae), it cannot be argued that the Gemara list is not
possibly an early form or basis of that in the synoptics; though on the
other hand the names Boni and Netzer suggest a mythop&oelig;ic origin
for Ebionites and Nazarenes. Leaving this issue aside as part of the
unsolved problem of the Talmudic Jesus, we are again driven to note the
unhistoric apparition of the twelve.</p>
<p class="par">Following the documents, we find the later traces
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>equally unveridical. Matthew is introduced in
the Acts as being chosen to make up the number of the twelve, on the
death of Judas; but never again is such a process mentioned; and
Matthew plays no part in the further narrative. And of course the cult
was interdicted from further maintenance of the number as soon as it
was settled that the twelve were to sit on twelve thrones judging the
twelve tribes of Israel, which had apparently been done in an early
Judaic form of the Apocalypse before it was intimated in the gospels.
Even in the Epistles, however, there is no real trace of an active
group of twelve. The number is mentioned only in a passage (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:5">1 Cor.
xv, 5</a>) where there is interpolation upon interpolation, for after
the statement that the risen Jesus appeared &ldquo;then to the
twelve&rdquo; there shortly follows &ldquo;then to all the
apostles,&rdquo; that is, on the traditionist assumption, to the twelve
again&mdash;the exclusion of Judas not being recognized. The
first-cited clause could be interpolated in order to insert the number;
the second could not have been inserted if the other were already
there.</p>
<p class="par">That is the sole allusion. We find none where we might
above all expect it, in the pseudo-biographical epistle to the
Galatians, though there is mention in the opening chapter of
&ldquo;them which were apostles before me,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
apostles,&rdquo; &ldquo;James the brother of the Lord&rdquo; (<i>never
mentioned as an apostle in the gospels</i> unless he be James the son
of Alph&aelig;us or James the son of Zebedee: that is, <i>not</i> a
brother of Jesus but simply a group-brother), and &ldquo;James and
Cephas and John, who were [<i>or</i> are] reputed to be pillars.&rdquo;
The language used in verse 6 excludes the notion that the writer
believed &ldquo;the apostles&rdquo; to have had personal intercourse
with the Founder. Thus even in a pseudepigraphic work, composed after
Paul&rsquo;s time, there is no suggestion that he had to deal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>with the twelve posited by the gospels and the
Acts. And all the while &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; without number continue
to figure in the documents. They were in fact a numerous class in the
early Church. It is not surprising that the late Professor Cheyne not
only rejected the story of the Betrayal but declared that &ldquo;The
&lsquo;Twelve Apostles,&rsquo; too, are to me as unhistorical as the
seventy disciples.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4548src" href=
"#xd23e4548" name="xd23e4548src">58</a></p>
<p class="par">On the other hand, we have a decisive reason for the

chapters, forming nearly half of the matter, are purely ethical and
monotheistic, developing the old formula of the &ldquo;Two Ways&rdquo;
of life and death; and saying nothing of Jesus or Christ or the Son, or
of baptism or sacrament. Then comes a palpably late interpolation,
giving a formula for baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and
the Holy Spirit. Even in the ninth section, dealing with the Eucharist,
we have only &ldquo;the holy vine of David thy Servant, which thou hast
made known to us through Jesus thy Servant.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e4571src" href="#xd23e4571" name="xd23e4571src">60</a> The
tenth, which is evidently later, and is written as a conclusion,
retains that formula. After that come warnings against false apostles
and prophets; and only in the twelfth section does the word
&ldquo;Christian&rdquo; occur. Still later there is specified
&ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s-day (<span class="trans" title=
"kyriak&#275;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&#8052;&nu;</span></span>)
<i>of the Lord</i>.&rdquo; Then comes a prescription for the election
of bishops; and the document ends with a chapter preparing for the
expected &ldquo;last days.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here then we have an originally Jewish document,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>bearing the title <span class="sc">Teaching of
the Twelve Apostles</span>, adopted and gradually added to by early
Jesuists who did not deify Jesus, though like the early Christians in
general they expected the speedy end of the world. Though their Jesus
is not deified, he has no cognomen. He is neither &ldquo;of
Nazareth,&rdquo; nor &ldquo;the Nazarite;&rdquo; and he is an
ostensibly mythical figure, not a teacher but a rite-founder, for his
adherents. They do not belong to an organized Church; and the baptismal
section, with its Trinitarian formula, is quite certainly one of the
latest of all. The eighth, which connects quite naturally with the
sixth, and which contains the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Prayer,&rdquo; raises
the question whether it belonged to the pre-Christian document, and has
been merely interpolated with the phrase as to &ldquo;the Lord ... his
gospel.&rdquo; There are strong reasons for regarding the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer as a pre-Christian Jewish composition,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4602src" href="#xd23e4602" name="xd23e4602src">61</a> founded on
very ancient Semitic prayers. Seeing that &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; has in
all the previous sections of the treatise clearly meant
&ldquo;God&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Christ,&rdquo; the passage about the
gospel is probably Jesuist; but it does not at all follow that the
Prayer is.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Cassels, in the section on the <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span> added by him in the one-volume reprint of his
great work, points<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4615src" href=
"#xd23e4615" name="xd23e4615src">62</a> to the fact that in the
recovered fragment of a Latin translation of an early version of
&ldquo;The Two Ways,&rdquo; there do not occur the passages connecting
with the Sermon on the Mount which are found in the <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span>; and as the same holds of the Two Ways section of
the <span class="sc">Epistle of Barnabas</span>, it may fairly be
argued that it was a Christian hand that added them here. But when we
note that at the points at which the passages in the <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span> vary from the gospel&mdash;as
&ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=
"#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>&ldquo;tax-gatherers,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e4632src" href="#xd23e4632" name=
"xd23e4632src">63</a>&mdash;the term in the former is perfectly natural
for Jewish teachers addressing Jews in Gentile countries, and that in
the latter rather strained in an exhortation to Jews in their own
country, it becomes very conceivable that this is the original, or a
prior form, of the gospel passage. The Sermon on the Mount is certainly
a compilation. This then may have been one of the sources. And it is
quite conceivable that the Jewish Apostles should teach their people
not to pray &ldquo;as do the hypocrites,&rdquo; an expression which Mr.
Cassels takes to be directed by Jesuists against Jews in general.</p>
<p class="par">Seeing that even conservative critics have admitted the
probable priority of the <span class="sc">Teaching</span> to
<span class="sc">Barnabas</span>, it is no straining of the
probabilities to suggest that the Two Ways section of <span class=
"sc">Barnabas</span> is either a variant, inspired by the <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span>, on what was clearly a very popular line of
homily,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4649src" href="#xd23e4649" name=
"xd23e4649src">64</a> or an annexation of another Jewish homily of that
kind. That in the <span class="sc">Teaching</span> is distinctly the
better piece of work, as we should expect the official manual of the
Apostles of the High Priest to be. It is inexact to say, as does Dr. M.
R. James,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4659src" href="#xd23e4659" name=
"xd23e4659src">65</a> that the section &ldquo;reappears&rdquo; in
<span class="sc">Barnabas</span>. There are many differences, as well
as many identities. The other is not a mere copy, but an exercise on
the same standard theme, with &ldquo;light and darkness&rdquo; for the
stronger &ldquo;life and death.&rdquo; It is a mistake to suppose that
there was a definite &ldquo;original&rdquo; of &ldquo;The Two
Ways&rdquo;: it is a standing ethical theme, evidently handled by
many.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4667src" href="#xd23e4667" name=
"xd23e4667src">66</a> If, then, the <span class="sc">Teaching</span>
preceded <span class="sc">Barnabas</span>, it may already have
contained, in its purely Jewish form, the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, which is
so thoroughly Jewish, and items <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134"
href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>of the Sermon on the Mount,
which is certainly a Jewish compilation. And the justified critical
presumption is that it did contain them. The onus of disproof lies on
the Christian side.</p>
<p class="par">We now reach our solution. The original document was in
any case a manual of teaching used among the scattered Jews and
proselytes of the Dispersion by the actual and historical Twelve
Apostles either of the High Priest before or of the Patriarch after the
fall of Jerusalem. The historic existence of that body before and after
the catastrophe is undisputed;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4684src"
href="#xd23e4684" name="xd23e4684src">67</a> and the nature of its
teaching functions can be confidently inferred from the known currency
of a Judaic ethical teaching in the early Christian period. The
demonstration of that is supplied by an expert of the biographical
school who considers the <span class="sc">Teaching</span> to have been
&ldquo;known to Jesus and the Baptist.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4692src" href="#xd23e4692" name="xd23e4692src">68</a> Such a
document cannot rationally be supposed to be a compilation made by or
for Christists using the gospels: such a compilation would have given
the gospel view of Jesus.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4695src" href=
"#xd23e4695" name="xd23e4695src">69</a> The primary <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span>, including as it probably does the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer, is the earlier thing: the gospels use it. It is in fact one of
the first documents of &ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; if not the first.
And its titular &ldquo;twelve apostles&rdquo; are Jewish and not
Christian.</p>
<p class="par">Given, then, such a document in the hands of the early
Jesuist organization&mdash;or one of the organizations&mdash;twelve
apostles had to be provided in the legend to take the credit for the
<span class="sc">Teaching</span>.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4709src"
href="#xd23e4709" name="xd23e4709src">70</a> The new cult, once it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>was shaped to the end of superseding the old,
had to provide itself to that extent, by myth, with the same machinery.
No step in the myth-theory is better established than this; and no
non-miraculous item in the legend is more recalcitrant than the twelve
story to the assumptions of the biographical school. The gospel list of
the twelve is one of the most unmanageable things in the record. In a
narrative destitute of detail where detail is most called for, we get a
list of names, most of which count for nothing in the later history, to
give a semblance of actuality to an invented institution. We have
clearly unhistorical detail as to five, no detail whatever as to
further accessions, and then a body of twelve suddenly constituted. For
some of us, the discovery of the <span class="sc">Teaching</span> was a
definite point of departure in the progression toward the myth-theory;
and it supplies us with the firmest starting-point for our theoretic
construction of the process by which the organized Christian Church
took shape.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the view here taken, there was at Jerusalem, at
some time in the first century, a small group of Jesuist
&ldquo;apostles&rdquo; among whom the chief may have been named James,
John, and Cephas. They <i>may</i> have been members of a ritual group
of twelve, who may have styled themselves Brothers of the Lord; but
that group in no way answered to the Twelve of the gospels. Of the
apostle class the number was indefinite. Besides the apostles, further,
there would seem to have been an indefinite number of
&ldquo;prophets,&rdquo; indicative of a cult of somewhat long standing.
The adherents believed in a non-historic Jesus, the
&ldquo;Servant&rdquo; of the Jewish God, somehow evolved out of the
remote Jesus-God who is reduced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136"
href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>to human status in the Old
Testament as Joshua. And their central secret rite consisted in a
symbolic sacrament, evolved out of an ancient sacrament of human
sacrifice, in which the victim had been the representative of the God,
sacrificed <i>to</i> the God, in the fashion of a hundred primitive
cults. This rite had within living memory, if not still at the time
from which we start, been accompanied by an annual popular rite in
which a selected person&mdash;probably a criminal released for the
purpose&mdash;was treated as a temporary king, then derided, and then
either in mock show or in actual fact executed, under the name of Jesus
Barabbas, &ldquo;the Son of the Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Of this ancient cult there were inferribly many
scattered centres outside of Judea, including probably some in Samaria,
the special region of the celebration of the Hero-God Joshua. There was
one such group in Ephesus; and probably another at Alexandria, and
another at Antioch; Jews of the Dispersion having possibly taken the
cult with them. But the cult outside Jewry may have had non-Jewish
roots, though it merged with Jewish elements. So long as the Temple at
Jerusalem lasted, the small cult counted for very little; and it was
probably after the fall of Jerusalem<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4742src" href="#xd23e4742" name="xd23e4742src">71</a> that its
leaders added to their machinery the rite of baptism, which the
synoptic gospels treat as a specialty of the movement of John the
Baptist. Him they represent as a &ldquo;forerunner&rdquo; of the
Christ, who under divine inspiration recognizes the Messianic claims of
Jesus. All this is plainly unhistorical, even on the assumption of the
historicity of Jesus.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4748src" href=
"#xd23e4748" name="xd23e4748src">72</a> Whatever may be the historic
facts as to John <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137"

figure,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4758src" href="#xd23e4758" name=

the fourth gospel on the subject of baptism<a class="noteref" id=

that rite was not originally Jesuist, but was adopted by the Jesuists
as a means of popular appeal.</p>
<p class="par">The recognition of this fact is a test of the critical
good faith of those who profess to found on the synoptics for a history
of the beginnings of the Jesuist cult. Canon Robinson<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e4770src" href="#xd23e4770" name="xd23e4770src">75</a> treats
as unquestionably historical one of the contradictory statements in
<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%204:1-2">John iv,
1&ndash;2</a>, of which the first affirms that Jesus baptized
abundantly, while the second, an evidently interpolated parenthesis,
asserts that only the disciples baptized, not Jesus. Though this
interpolation hinges on the first dictum, the Canon accepts it to the
exclusion of that, its basis. But the original writer could not have
put the proposition thus had he believed it. What he affirmed was
abundant baptizing by Jesus. Of this, however, the synoptics have no
more hint than they have of baptizing by the disciples. On any possible
view of the composition of the synoptics, it is inconceivable that they
should omit all mention of baptizing by Jesus or the disciples if such
a practice was affirmed in the early tradition. For them baptism is the
institution of the Forerunner, who is mythically represented as hailing
in Jesus his successor or supersessor, with no suggestion of a
continuance of the rite. If there is to be any critical consistency in
the biographical argument, it must at least recognize that baptism is
non-Jesuine.</p>
<p class="par">The embodiment of the rite of baptism on the basis of
the Baptist&rsquo;s alleged acclamation of Jesus as the Messiah,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>either carried with it or followed upon the
claim that Jesus, hitherto regarded as a simple Saviour-God, was a
Messiah. After the fall of Jerusalem, the old dream of an earthly
Messiah who should restore the Kingdom of Judah or Israel<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4785src" href="#xd23e4785" name=
"xd23e4785src">76</a> was shattered for the vast majority of Jews. Even
in the <span class="sc">Assumption of Moses</span>, in the main the
work of a Quietist Pharisee, written in Hebrew probably between 7 and
29 of the first century,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4797src" href=
"#xd23e4797" name="xd23e4797src">77</a> there is a virtual abandonment
of Messianism, the task of overthrowing the Gentiles being assigned to
&ldquo;the Most High.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4803src" href=
"#xd23e4803" name="xd23e4803src">78</a> In the composite <span class=

Pharisaic Jews, in the latter half of the first century, probably as an
implicit polemic against early Jesuism,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4812src" href="#xd23e4812" name="xd23e4812src">79</a> we see the
effect of the catastrophe. In the sections written before the fall of
Jerusalem, the hope of a Messianic Kingdom is proclaimed; in those
written later there is either at most a hope of a Messianic Kingdom
without a Messiah or a complete abandonment of mundane
expectations.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4818src" href="#xd23e4818"
name="xd23e4818src">80</a> What the Jesuist movement did was to
develop, outside of Jewry,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4823src" href=
"#xd23e4823" name="xd23e4823src">81</a> the earlier notion of a Messiah
&ldquo;concealed,&rdquo; pre-appointed, and coming from heaven to
effect the consummation of all things earthly.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4828src" href="#xd23e4828" name="xd23e4828src">82</a></p>
<p class="par">Such Messianism may have either preceded or proceeded-on
an adoption of the rite of baptism. Given a resort to Messianism by the
Jesuists after the fall of Jerusalem, the alleged testimony of the
Baptist to Jesus as the Appointed One might be the first step; and the
resort to the baptismal rite would follow on the myth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>that
Jesus had been actually baptized by John. In <a class="biblink xd23e43"

Pauline epistles we have trace of a conflict over this as over other
Judaic practices, Paul being made to declare (<a class=

gospel,&rdquo; though he admits having baptized a few.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4847src" href="#xd23e4847" name=
"xd23e4847src">84</a> All that is clear is that the Jesuists were not
primarily baptizers; that they began to baptize &ldquo;in the name of
Jesus Christ,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4854src" href=
"#xd23e4854" name="xd23e4854src">85</a> with a formula of the Holy
Ghost and fire, but really in the traditional manner with water; and
that long afterwards they feigned that the Founder had prescribed
baptism with a trinitarian formula.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4859src"
href="#xd23e4859" name="xd23e4859src">86</a></p>
<p class="par">Thus far, the local movement was not only Jewish but
Judaic. It may or may not have been before the fall of Jerusalem that a
Jesuist &ldquo;apostle&rdquo; named Paul conceived the idea of creating
by propaganda a new Jud&aelig;o-Jesuist movement appealing to Gentiles.
Such an idea is not the <i>invention</i> of Paul or any other Jesuist;
the idea of a Messianic Kingdom in which the Gentiles should be saved
is found in the Jewish <span class="sc">Testaments of the Twelve
Patriarchs</span>, written in Hebrew by a Pharisee between the years
109 and 106 <span class="sc">B.C.</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4877src" href="#xd23e4877" name="xd23e4877src">87</a> But, thus
made current, it might well be adopted by Jesuists. The reason for
supposing this to have begun before the year 70 is not merely the
tradition to that effect but the fact that in none of the epistles do
we have any trace of that &ldquo;gospel of the Kingdom&rdquo; which in
the synoptics <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>is posited as the evangel of Jesus. That
evangel, which is a simple duplication of the alleged evangel of the
Baptist, and which we have seen to be wholly mythical, being devoid of
possible historic content,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4884src" href=
"#xd23e4884" name="xd23e4884src">88</a> is part of the apparatus of the
retrospective Messianic claim. But the Pauline Epistles, even as they
show no knowledge of the name Nazareth, or Nazar&aelig;an, or Nazarene,
or of any gospel teaching, also show no concern over a &ldquo;gospel of
the Kingdom.&rdquo; Whether or not, then, they are wholly
pseudepigraphic, they suggest that a Paulinism of some kind was an
early feature in the Jesuist evolution.</p>
<p class="par">According to the Acts, Paul&rsquo;s name was originally
Saul, though no such avowal is ever made in the epistles. The purpose
of the statement seems to be to strengthen the case as to his Jewish
nationality, which <i>is</i> affirmed in the epistles, as is the item
that he had been a murderous persecutor of the early Jesuists. All this
suggests a late manipulation of the traditions of an early strife. To
claim that the Gentilizing apostle had been a Jew born and bred would
be as natural on the Gentilizing side as to allege that the typically
Judaic Peter had denied his Lord; while the charge of persecuting the
infant church would be a not less natural invention of the Judaic
Christians who accepted the tradition that Paul had been a Pharisee and
a pupil of Gamaliel. In point of fact we find the Ebionites, the
typical Judaic Jesuists, knowing him simply as &ldquo;Paul of
Tarsus&rdquo; in their version of the Acts or in a previous document
upon which that founded.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4894src" href=
"#xd23e4894" name="xd23e4894src">89</a> And many Jewish scholars have
declared that they cannot conceive the Pauline epistles to have been
written by a Rabbinically trained Jew.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4903src" href="#xd23e4903" name="xd23e4903src">90</a> This does
not preclude <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>the possibility that the original Paul, of whose
&ldquo;few very short epistles&rdquo; personally penned<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4910src" href="#xd23e4910" name=
"xd23e4910src">91</a> we have probably nothing left that is
identifiable,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4917src" href="#xd23e4917"
name="xd23e4917src">92</a> may have been such a Jew, but the
presumption is to the contrary.</p>
<p class="par">On the face of the case, nothing was more natural than
that the Jesuist movement should appeal to civilized Gentiles. Judaism
itself did so, striving much after proselytes. The question was whether
the Jesuist proselytes should be made on a strictly Judaic basis. Now,
even if the fall of Jerusalem had not given the impetus to a severance
of the cult from the dominating religion, the sacred domicile being
gone, it is obvious that an abandonment of such a Jewish bar as
circumcision would give the developing cult a great advantage over the
other in propaganda among Gentiles. Circumcision must have been a
highly repellent detail for Hellenistic Gentiles in general; and a
gospel which dispensed with it would have a new chance of making
headway. And such a severance certainly took place, though we can put
no reliance on the chronology of the Acts.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4922src" href="#xd23e4922" name="xd23e4922src">93</a>
Paul<a class="noteref" id="xd23e4930src" href="#xd23e4930" name=
"xd23e4930src">94</a> remains a doubtfully dated figure, because the
chronology of the whole cult is problematic.</p>
<p class="par">But we can broadly distinguish between a
&ldquo;Petrine&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Pauline&rdquo; Christism. In the
Acts (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:22-40">ii,
22&ndash;40</a>), which clearly embodies earlier lore, prior to that of
the gospels, the Jesus Christ preached by Peter is not represented as a
saving sacrifice. As little is he a Teacher, though he is a doer of
&ldquo;mighty works and wonders and signs.&rdquo; If we were to apply
the biographical method, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>the presentment might be held to
indicate the Talmudic Jesus. Only <i>after</i> his resurrection
&ldquo;God hath made him both Lord and Christ&rdquo;&mdash;that is,
Messiah; and the Jewish hearers are invited to &ldquo;repent&rdquo; and
be &ldquo;baptized ... in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission
of your sins.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s Jesus, like him of the <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span>, is the &ldquo;Servant&rdquo; of God, not his Son.
And there is no mention of a sacrament, though there is noted a
&ldquo;breaking of bread at home&rdquo; (42, 46) recalling the
&ldquo;broken&rdquo; (bread) of the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>. The
sacrament, then, was apparently a secret rite for the Jewish group.</p>
<p class="par">The speeches, of course, are quite unhistorical: we can
but take them as embodying a traditional &ldquo;Petrine&rdquo; teaching
with later matter. Thus we have baptism figuring as a Jesuist rite,
whereas in the synoptics, as we have seen, there had been no such
thing. The story of Peter being brought to the pro-Gentile view is pure
ecclesiastical myth, probably posterior to the Pauline epistles, which
are ignored but counteracted in so far as they posit strife between
Pauline and Petrine propaganda. Peter and Paul alike are made to teach
that &ldquo;it behoved the Christ to suffer&rdquo; (iii, 18; xvii, 3),
even as they duplicate their miracles, their escapes, and their
sufferings. But while Peter is pretended to have accepted Gentilism, it
is Paul who acts on the principle; and he it is who is first
represented as fighting pagan polytheism, notably at Ephesus (xix, 26).
At Athens, in a plainly fictitious speech, he is made to expound the
&ldquo;unknown God&rdquo; of an Athenian agnostic cult in terms of
Jewish opposition to image-worship, indicating Jesus merely as &ldquo;a
man&rdquo; raised by God from the dead to judge the world at the
judgment day. It is <i>after</i> this episode that he is made to tell
the Jews of Corinth he will &ldquo;henceforth go unto the
Gentiles.&rdquo; Nevertheless he is made to go on preaching

"pb143">143</a>]</span>to the Jews. The narrative as a whole is plainly
factitious: all we can hope to do is to detect some of its historic
data.</p>
<p class="par">Two things must be kept clearly and constantly in view:
first, that what we understand by a literary and a historical
conscience simply did not exist in the early Christian environment;
second, that in all probability the Acts, which to start with would be
a blend of tradition and fiction, is much manipulated during a long
period. We are not entitled to assume that an &ldquo;original&rdquo;
writer duplicated the careers of Peter and Paul for purposes of
edification. One or more may have wrought one narrative, and a later
hand or hands may have systematically interpolated the other.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e4967src" href="#xd23e4967" name=
"xd23e4967src">95</a> We are to remember further that it was an age in
which most Christians, assimilating the eschatology of the Persians and
the Jews&mdash;the spontaneous dream of crushed peoples&mdash;expected
the speedy end of the world, and did their thinking on that basis. In
such a state of mind, critical thought could not exist save as a small
element in religious polemic.</p>
<p class="par">Let us then see what we reach on the hypothesis that
early Jesuism even in the first century, and possibly even before the
fall of Jerusalem, was running in two different channels&mdash;one
movement adhering to Jewish usage, making Jesus the Servant of God, and
conceiving him as a God-gifted Healer whose death raised him to the
status of the Messiah, the promised Christ or Anointed One who should
either close the earthly scene or bring about a new God-ruled era
<i>for the Jews</i>. For the holders of this view, the Kingdom of God
was <i>coming</i>. Jesus was ere long to come in the clouds in great
glory and inaugurate the new life. To ask for clear conceptions on such
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>matter from such minds would be idle. There were
none. The one idea connected with the mythical evangel was that Jews
should repent and prepare for the new life. To that elusive minimum the
latest biographical analysis, assuming the historicity, reduces the
&ldquo;ministry&rdquo; of the gospel Jesus.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e4980src" href="#xd23e4980" name="xd23e4980src">96</a> The rest is
all post-apostolic accretion. On the other hand, the Petrine Jesus has
proved his mission for his devotees, first and last, by miracles, and
by his resurrection&mdash;things which the biographical school rejects
as imaginary.</p>
<p class="par">Upon this movement there enters an innovator, Paul of
Tarsus. Round him, as round Peter, there are clouds of myth. That he
was originally Saul, a Pharisee, a pupil of Gamaliel; that he began as
a bitter persecutor of the Jesuists; and that he was converted by a
supernatural vision, become common data for the church. That the charge
of persecution was a Judaic figment, on the other hand, is perhaps as
likely as that the story of Peter&rsquo;s denial of his Master was a
Gentile figment. We are in a world of purposive fiction. But the broad
divergence of doctrine seems to underlie all the fables. Saul, on the
later view, changes his Jewish name to the Grecian Paul when he plans
to make the Jesus-cult non-Jewish, using the tactic of monotheism
against pagan polytheism in general, in the very act of adding a
Son-God to the Jewish Father-God, as so many Son-Gods had been added to
Father-Gods throughout religious history. To the early Jewish Jesuists,
the notion of the Son had been given by the old cult of sacrifice, with
its Jesus the Son&mdash;an idea obscurely but certainly present, as we
have seen, in the lore of the Talmudists.</p>
<p class="par">Clearly it was the Pauline movement that made of
Christism a &ldquo;viable&rdquo; world religion. As an unorganized
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>Saviour-cult it would have died out like others.
As a phase of Judaism, it could have had no Jewish permanence, simply
because its Messianism was a matter of looking daily for an &ldquo;end
of the world&rdquo; that did not come. After two centuries of waiting,
the Jews would have had as clear a right to pronounce Jesus a
&ldquo;false Messiah&rdquo; as they had in the case of Barcochab or any
other before or since. The mere belief in a future life, at one time
excluded from their Sacred Books, had become the common faith, only the
aristocratic Sadducees (probably not all of them) rejecting it. On that
side, Jesuism gave them nothing. Well might Paul &ldquo;turn to the
Gentiles&rdquo;&mdash;albeit not under the circumstances theologically
imagined for him in the book of Acts.</p>
<p class="par">Even for the Gentiles, Jesuism was but one of many
competing cults, offering similar attractions. In the religions of
Adonis, Attis, Isis and Osiris, Dionysos, Mithra, and the Syrian Marnas
(&ldquo;the Lord, a variant of Adonis = Adonai, one of the Jews&rsquo;
exoteric names for Yahweh&rdquo;), a resplendent ever-youthful God who
had died to rise again was sacramentally adored, mourned for, and
rejoiced over, by devotees just as absorbed in their faith as were the
Jesuists. With vague pretences of biographical knowledge, to which
nobody now attaches any credence, they were as sure of the historicity
of their Vegetation-Gods and Sun-Gods as the Christists were of the
actuality of theirs. Had a Frazer of the second century told them that
their Adonis and Attis were but abstractions of the annual sacrificial
victim of old time, they would have told him, in the manner of Festus
(not yet obsolete), that much learning had made him mad. They
&ldquo;knew&rdquo; that their Redeemer had lived, died, and risen
again. The unbelief of philosophers, or of scoffers like Lucian,
affected them no more than scientific and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>critical unbelief
to-day disturbs the majority of unthinking Christians. The busy
sacrificial and devotional life of Hierapolis would be as little
affected by Lucian&rsquo;s tranquil exhibition of it as the life at
Lourdes has been by Zola&rsquo;s novel. On that side, we can very
easily understand the past by the present.</p>
<p class="par">So little psychic or intellectual difference was there
between Jesuism and the other &ldquo;isms&rdquo; that Paul&rsquo;s
propaganda made no measurable sensation in the colluvies of the Roman
empire. As Renan avows, even on the assumption of the genuineness of
the Epistles, he was the missioner of a number of small conventicles,
all convinced that they alone were the &ldquo;true Church of God upon
earth.&rdquo; It is an error of perspective to ascribe extraordinary
faculty to the missionary who either converted or
&ldquo;stablished&rdquo; such believers; and it is plainly unnecessary
to assume in his case any abnormal sincerity or persuasiveness. If we
were to estimate him in terms of the records we should describe him
either as a <i lang="fr">hallucin&eacute;</i> or as a fanatic who had
shed Christian blood in his Judaic stage and never in the least learned
humility on that score, his phrases of contrition being balanced by the
fiercest asperities towards all who withstood him in his Christian
stage. But we have no right to draw a portrait of &ldquo;Paul,&rdquo;
who is left to us a composite of literary figments testifying only to
the previous activity of a propagandist so-named.</p>
<p class="par">One conclusion, however, holds alike whether or not we
accept any of the epistles as genuine: or rather, the more we lean on
the epistles the more it holds: Paul had no concern about the life,
teachings, or &ldquo;personality&rdquo; of his Jesus.<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e5002src" href="#xd23e5002" name="xd23e5002src">97</a> His
Jesus, be it said once more, is a speechless abstraction. One of the
strangest fallacies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147"
name="pb147">147</a>]</span>in the procedure of the biographical school
is the assumption that the acceptance of the epistles as genuine
involves the admission of the historicity of the Founder. In actual
fact, it was a belief in the substantial genuineness of the main
epistles that first strengthened the present writer in his first
surmises of the non-historicity of the entire gospel record; just as a
perception of the historical situation broadly set forth in Judges
confirms doubt as to the historicity of the record of the Hexateuch.
The two will not consist. On the other hand, Van Manen, who had
previously been troubled about the historicity of Jesus, was positively
set at rest on that score when he reached the conclusion that all the
Paulines were supposititious. This happened simply because he had
scientifically covered the field only on the Pauline side: had he
applied equivalent tests to the gospels, he would have reached there
too a verdict of fabrication. There is strictly no absolute
<i>sequitur</i> in such a case. The myth-theory is neither made nor
marred by the rejection of the Paulines.</p>
<p class="par">Even those who cannot realize the indifference of
&ldquo;Paul&rdquo; to all personal records of his Jesus&mdash;or,
recognizing it, are content to explain it away by formulas&mdash;must
see on consideration that belief in a Saviour God no more needed
biographical basis in the case of Paul than in the case of the priests
of Mithra, who, it may be noted, had a strong centre at
Tarsus.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5018src" href="#xd23e5018" name=
"xd23e5018src">98</a> There is a certain plausibility in the argument
that only a great personality could have made possible the belief in
the Resurrection story&mdash;though that too is fallacy&mdash;but there
is no plausibility in inferring that a conception of a personality he
had never personally known was needed to impel Paul to <i>his</i>
evangel, which is simply one of future salvation by divine sacrifice
for all who believe. That is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148"
href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>substitution made by Gentile
Christism for the miscarrying Messianism of the Petrine doctrine. It
was probably the normal doctrine of many pagan cults&mdash;Mithraism
for one, which for three hundred years, by common consent, was the
outstanding rival of Christianity in the Roman empire.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5030src" href="#xd23e5030" name=
"xd23e5030src">99</a> It was, then, no specialty of dogma that
ultimately determined the success of the one and the disappearance of
the other. It was a concatenation of real or &ldquo;external&rdquo;
causes, not a peculiarity of mere belief.</p>

<p class="par first">The more we study comparatively the fortunes of
the Christian and the rival cults, the more difficult it is to conceive
that it made headway in virtue of sheer monotheism. If we assume that
Judaism had made its proselytes in the pagan world by reason of the
appeal made by its monotheism to the more thoughtful minds, we are
bound to infer that Christism was on that side rather at a
disadvantage, inasmuch as it was really adding a new deity, with a
&ldquo;Holy Spirit&rdquo; superadded, to the God of the Jews.</p>
<p class="par">But the ordinary argument as to the vogue of &ldquo;pure
monotheism&rdquo; at any time is in the main a series of traditional
assumptions. For the more thoughtful of the ancients, polytheism was
always tending to pass into monotheism. We see the process going on in
the Vedas, in Brahmanism, in the Egyptian system, in the
Babylonian&mdash;to say nothing of the Greek.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5046src" href="#xd23e5046" name="xd23e5046src">100</a> It
proceeded partly by way of henotheism&mdash;the tendency to exalt any
particular deity as <i>the</i> deity: partly by way of the compelled
surmise that all the deities of the popular <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>creeds were but aspects or names of one
all-controlling Power. Wherever creeds <i>met</i>, the more thoughtful
were driven to ask themselves whether the heavens could be a mere
reflex of the earth, with every nation represented by its special God;
and to fuse the national Gods into one was but a step to fusing the
Gods of the various natural forces into one. Since religions became
organized, there must always have been monotheists, as there must
always have been unbelievers.</p>
<p class="par">Nevertheless, polytheism is just as surely popular as
monotheism is inevitable to the more thoughtful who remain
&ldquo;religious&rdquo; in the natural sense of the term. One of the
great delusions maintained by the acceptance of the falsified history
of Judaism and the conventional religion of the Bible is the notion
that the Jews were a specially monotheistic people. They were
not.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5065src" href="#xd23e5065" name=
"xd23e5065src">101</a> They were originally tribalists like their
neighbours, holding by <i>a</i> tribal God and a hierarchy of inferior
Gods. To this day we are seriously told that Abraham made a new
departure as a monotheist. Abraham is a mythical patriarch, himself
once a deity; and the deity represented to have been believed in by
Abraham is a tribal God. And not even the tribal God was
monotheistically worshipped. The Sacred Books are one long chain of
complaints against the Israelites for their perpetual resort to
&ldquo;strange Gods&rdquo;&mdash;and Goddesses.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5075src" href="#xd23e5075" name="xd23e5075src">102</a></p>
<p class="par">Two brilliant French scholars have advanced the thesis
that this alleged polytheism is imaginary;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5085src" href="#xd23e5085" name="xd23e5085src">103</a> and that
the Israelites in the mass always worshipped only the One God
Yahweh.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5091src" href="#xd23e5091" name=
"xd23e5091src">104</a> But this position, which is grounded
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>on the inference that the mass of the historical
and prophetic literature is post-exilic, outgoes its own grounds. Even
if we assume, with the theorists, that Jewish monotheism was
universalist from the moment it took shape <i>as</i> monotheism in
literature,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5105src" href="#xd23e5105" name=
"xd23e5105src">105</a> we get rid neither of the question of pre-exilic
polytheism nor of that of popular survival. To say that the post-exilic
Jews are &ldquo;the only Jews known to history,&rdquo; and that the
apparently old lore in Genesis is &ldquo;perhaps really the most
modern,&rdquo; being invented for purposes of parable, is only a
screening of the fact that the Hebrews evolved religiously like other
peoples. A resort to alien Gods is seen to be universal in the
religious history of the ancient world. Every conquered race was
suspected to have secret power in respect of &ldquo;the God of the
land<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5109src" href="#xd23e5109" name=
"xd23e5109src">106</a>&rdquo;; and <span class="corr" id="xd23e5114"
title="Source: where-ever">wherever</span> races mixed, cults mixed. It
is only on a provision of special Sacred Books, themselves treated as
fetishes, that the attractions of alien cults can be repelled; and not
even Sacred Books can make real monotheists of an uncultured majority.
Even later Judaism, with its angels, its Metatron, its Satan, was never
truly monotheistic.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5117src" href=
"#xd23e5117" name="xd23e5117src">107</a> Islam is not. The universalism
which in later Judaism still commonly passes for a specialty of the
Hebrew mind was really an assimilation and development of
Perso-Babylonian ideas;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5123src" href=
"#xd23e5123" name="xd23e5123src">108</a> and Satan made a dualism of
the Jewish creed even as Ahriman did of the Persian. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In the Romanized world, Judaism had never a really great
success of proselytism, just because the more cultured had their own
monotheism, and had in Greek literature something more satisfactory
than the Hebraic, with its barbaric basis of racialism and its
apparatus of circumcision, synagogues and Sabbaths. The proselytes were
made in general among the less cultured&mdash;not the populace, but the
serious men of religious predilections, who were the more impressed by
the Sacred Books as rendered in the Septuagint because they were not at
home in the higher literature of Greece. And if Judaism could not sweep
the Roman empire in virtue of monotheism, Christism could not,
especially while it lacked sacred books of its own.</p>
<p class="par">Professor Smith&rsquo;s thesis of a rapid monotheistic
triumph is partly founded on his own vivid interpretation of many of
the gospel stories of cast-out demons and diseases as a symbolism for
successes against polytheism. And his symbolistic interpretation, which
is at first sight apt to seem arbitrary, is really important at many
points, accounting as it does convincingly for a number of gospel
stories. But if we are to assume that <i>all</i> the gospel stories of
casting out devils, curing lepers, healing the lame, and giving sight
to the blind, were <i>composed</i> with a symbolic intent, we shall
still be left asking on what grounds the Name of Jesus made any popular
appeal before and after the symbolizing gospels were compiled.</p>
<p class="par">Professor Smith draws a powerful picture of the relief
given by monotheism to polytheists. In his eloquent words, the
&ldquo;tyranny of demons&rdquo; had &ldquo;trodden down humanity in
dust and mire since the first syllable of recorded time&rdquo;; and the
new proclamation &ldquo;roused a world, dissolved the fetters of the
tyrannizing demons, set free the prisoners of superstition, poured
light upon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>the eyes of the blind, and called a universe to
life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5144src" href="#xd23e5144"
name="xd23e5144src">109</a> But let us be clear as to the facts. If by
&ldquo;demons&rdquo; we understand the <i>Gods</i> of the heathen,
there was really no more &ldquo;bondage&rdquo; under polytheism than
under monotheism. Spiritual bondage can be and is set up by the fear of
One God who is supposed to meddle actively with all life;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5152src" href="#xd23e5152" name=
"xd23e5152src">110</a> and the Jewish law was in itself notoriously an
intellectual and social bondage. It is expressly represented as such in
the Pauline epistles. If again we have regard to the fear of
&ldquo;evil spirits,&rdquo; there was really no difference between Jew
and Gentile, for the &ldquo;superstition&rdquo; of the Jew in those
matters was unbounded.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5158src" href=
"#xd23e5158" name="xd23e5158src">111</a> Nor is there any ground for
thinking that the Jew had more confidence than other people in divine
protection from the spirits of evil.</p>
<p class="par">In what respect, then, are we to suppose Jesuist
monotheism to have been an innovation? The argument seems to require
that Jesuism delivered the polytheist from belief in the
<i>existence</i> either of his daimon Gods or of his evil spirits. But
obviously it negated neither of these. Daimons of all sorts are
constantly presupposed in Jesuist polemic. The &ldquo;freedom in
Christ&rdquo; proffered to Jews and Gentiles by the Pauline evangel is,
in the terms of the case, not a freedom from the terrors of polytheism
as such. It was certainly not regarded as a freedom, from
&ldquo;demons,&rdquo; for exorcism against demons was a standing
function in the early church for centuries; and the fear of a demon or
demons is implicit in the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&rdquo; What is
proffered is primarily a freedom from the Jewish ceremonial law, and
secondarily a freedom from fear in respect of the judgment-day and the
future <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>life, the divine sacrifice having taken away all
sin. We are told by eloquent missionaries in our own day<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5171src" href="#xd23e5171" name=
"xd23e5171src">112</a> that the Christian doctrine gives a new sense of
freedom and security to negroes, in particular to the women; though we
also learn on the other hand that where the two religions can compete
freely Islam makes the stronger claim in respect of its exclusion of
the race bar which Christianity always sets up in the rear of its
evangel. But here, if the fear of evil spirits is really cast out, it
is by a <i>modern</i> doctrine of their non-existence, not found in the
New Testament, but generated by modern science.</p>
<p class="par">Whatever preaching of monotheism, then, entered into
early Jesuism, it gave no deliverance from belief in evil spirits:
rather it added to their number by turning good daimons into bad. What
is more, there enters into Christian polemic at a fairly early stage a
use of the terms &ldquo;God&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gods&rdquo; for the
&ldquo;saints&rdquo; which is on all fours with the common language of
Paganism;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5184src" href="#xd23e5184" name=
"xd23e5184src">113</a> and this is a much more common note than the
&ldquo;high&rdquo; monotheism of the Apology of Aristides, which has
hardly any Christian characteristics. His monotheism is rather Pagan
than Christian. The broad fact remains that so far as we can know the
early Jesuist polemic from the gospels, the Acts, the Epistles, the
Apocalypse, or the patristic literature, it was not a wide and
successful assault on polytheism <i>as such</i> by an appeal to
monotheistic instinct, but just a proffer to Jews and Gentiles of a
kind of creed common enough in the pagan world, its inconsistent
monotheism appealing only to a minority of the recipients.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5198src" href="#xd23e5198" name=
"xd23e5198src">114</a> The very miracle-stories which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>Professor Smith interprets as allegories of
monotheistic propaganda became part of the popular appeal as soon as
they were made current in documents; and they <i>appealed</i> (he will
admit) as miracle-stories, not as allegories. Peter and Paul in their
turn are represented as working miracles of healing. It was all finally
part of the appeal to primary religious credulity.</p>
<p class="par">Of two positions, then, we must choose one. Either the
miracle-stories of the gospels, and by consequence those of the Acts,
were as such otiose inventions for an audience which, on the view under
discussion, would have been much more responsive to an explicit claim
of <i>triumph over polytheistic beliefs</i>, the thing they are said to
have been most deeply concerned about, <i>or</i> the miracle stories in
general were meant as miracle-stories, only some later symbolists
seeking to impose a symbolic sense on the records along with the
Gnostic conception that the Christ had spoken in allegories which the
people were not <i>meant</i> to understand. This later manipulation
undoubtedly did take place. The parable of the Rich One, as Professor
Smith convincingly shows, is an allegory of Jew and Gentile&mdash;the
Rich One being Israel. But it is not by such manipulation that cults
are made popular, congregations collected, and revenue secured. And it
was on these practical lines that Christianity was
&ldquo;stablished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The factors which made this one Eastern cult gradually
gain ground, and finally hold its ground, as against the many rival
cults, were&mdash;</p>
<p class="par">1. The system of <i lang="la">ecclesi&aelig;</i>,
modelled at once on the Jewish synagogue and the pagan <i lang=
"la">collegia</i>.</p>
<p class="par">2. The practice of mutual help, making the churches
Friendly Societies&mdash;again an assimilation of common pagan
practice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">3. The <i>colligation</i> of the churches, primarily by
means of a new sacred literature of gospels and epistles, and
secondarily by a system of centralized government, partly modelled on
the imperial system.</p>
<p class="par">4. The backing of the new Christian Sacred Books by the
Jewish Sacred Books, giving an ancient Eastern background and basis for
the faith in a world in which Eastern religious elements were
progressively overriding the Western, which had in comparison no
documentary basis.</p>
<p class="par">5. The giving to the whole process a relatively
democratic character, again after the model of the Jewish system,
wherein the people had their main recognition as human beings with
rights. Thus Christianity was at once a &ldquo;secret society&rdquo;
under an autocracy, as were so many Hellenistic religious groups,
drawing members as such societies always do in autocratically governed
States,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5240src" href="#xd23e5240" name=
"xd23e5240src">115</a> and a popular movement as contrasted with
Mithraism, which always remained a mere secret society, whence its easy
ultimate suppression by the Christianized government.</p>
<p class="par">6. It was the wide ramification and popular importance
of the Christian system that at length made it worth the while of the
emperor to cease persecuting it as a partly anti-imperial organization
and to turn it into an imperial instrument by making it the religion of
the State.</p>
<p class="par">To explain the process as the morally deserved success
of a religion superior from the start, in virtue of the superiority of
its nominal Founder, would be to adhere to pre-scientific conceptions
of causation, akin to the geocentric assumption in astronomy. Hierology
ultimately merges in sociology, as mythology and anthropology (in the
English limitation of the term) merge in hierology; and sociology is a
study of the reaction of environments as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>well as of the action
of institutions and doctrines. The Christian success was finally
achieved by the assimilation of all manner of pagan modes of attraction
on the side of creed, and the absolute ultimate subordination of the
specialties of early Christian ethic to the business of political
adaptation.</p>
<p class="par">And to all attempts to obscure the problem by figuring
Christianity as a continuously beneficent and purifying force it is
sufficient here to answer that it is in strict fact a religious variant
which survived in a decaying civilization, a politically and socially
decaying world; that it lent itself to that decay; and that it did less
than nothing to avert it.</p>
<p class="par">Where superior hostile power efficiently fought it, it
was suppressed just as it suppressed the organized cults of paganism
and some (not all) of its own heretical sects. Its further survival,
which does not here properly concern us, was but a matter of the
renewed &ldquo;triumph&rdquo; of an organized over unorganized

against idolatry and a crusade for monotheism could Proto-Christianity
have succeeded with the Gentiles. But that was simply the line of
Judaism, which had no Son-God to cloud its monotheism. Surely Jesuism
appealed to the Gentiles primarily as did other Saviour-cults,
ultimately distancing these by reason of organization.&nbsp;<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is important to realize in some detail the
operation of the economic factor in particular, and of organization in
general, before we try to grasp synthetically the total process of
documentary and doctrinal construction. The former is somewhat
sedulously ignored in ordinary historiography, by reason of a general
unwillingness even among rationalists to seem to connect mercenary
motives with religious beginnings; and of the general assumption among
religionists that &ldquo;true&rdquo; or &ldquo;early&rdquo; religion
operates in spite of, in defiance or in independence of and not by aid
of, economic motives. No one will dispute that the history of the Roman
Catholic Church is one of economic as well as doctrinal action and
reaction, or that Protestantism from the first was in large measure an
economic processus. But it is commonly assumed, at least implicitly,
that &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; religion, religion &ldquo;in the
making,&rdquo; is not at all an affair of economic motive or
reaction.</p>
<p class="par">Those who have at all closely studied primitive
religious life know that this is not so.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5274src" href="#xd23e5274" name="xd23e5274src">1</a> The savage
medicine-man is up to his lights as keenly concerned about his economic
interest as were the priests of ancient Babylon and Egypt&mdash;to take
instances that can hardly give modern offence.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5279src" href="#xd23e5279" name="xd23e5279src">2</a> And to say
this is not to say that the &ldquo;religion&rdquo; involved
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>is insincere, in the case of the savage or the
pagan any more than in that of the modern ecclesiastic or missionary.
It is merely to say that religion has always its economic side, and
that faith may go with economic self-seeking as easily as with
self-sacrifice. I at least am not prepared to say that when the
Franciscans in general passed from the state of voluntary poverty to
that of corporate wealth they ceased to be sincere believers; or that a
bishop is necessarily less pious than a Local Preacher.</p>
<p class="par">I have seen, in Egypt, the life of a Moslem
&ldquo;saint&rdquo; in the making. He fasted much, certainly never
eating more than one meal a day, and he was visibly emaciated and
feeble as a result of his abstinences. Over his devout neighbours he
had an immense influence. To his religious addresses they listened with
rapt reverence; and when once in my presence he gave to a young man a
religious charm to cure his sick sister, in the shape of a cigarette
paper inscribed with a text from the Koran and rolled up to be
swallowed, the youth&rsquo;s face was transfigured with joyous faith,
his eyes shining as if he had seen a glorious vision. I have not seen
more radiant faith, in or out of &ldquo;Israel.&rdquo; And the saint,
all the same, took unconcealed satisfaction in showing privately the
heavy purse of gold he had recently collected from his faithful. To
call him insincere would be puerile. I believe him to have been as
sincere as Luther or Loyola. He simply happened, like so many Easterns
and Westerns, to combine the love of pelf with the love of God.</p>
<p class="par">If I am told there were no such men among the early
Jesuists or Christian propagandists, I answer that if there had not
been the cult would not have gone very far. Of course the records
minimize the economic side. In the gospels we are told that Judas
carried &ldquo;the bag,&rdquo; but never anything of what he got to put
in it. But in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>the Acts, the economic factor obtrudes itself
even in myth. A picture is there drawn (<a class="biblink xd23e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%202:44">ii, 44</a>),
for the edification of later Christians, of the first community as
having &ldquo;all things common&rdquo;&mdash;a statement which we have
no reason to believe true of any ancient Christian community
whatever&mdash;unless in the &ldquo;pre-apostolic&rdquo;
period.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5295src" href="#xd23e5295" name=
"xd23e5295src">3</a> The picture never recurs, in the apostolic history
or elsewhere. And the purpose of edification is unconsciously turned to
the account of revelation. Of the faithful it is represented that they
&ldquo;sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all,
according as any man had need.&rdquo; The assertion is reiterated (iv,
34) to the extent of alleging that all who had houses or lands sold
all, bringing the proceeds to the apostles for distribution
&ldquo;according as any one had need.&rdquo; Among these having need
would certainly be the &ldquo;apostles.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Soon one of the faithful, Joseph surnamed Barnabas,
&ldquo;a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race,&rdquo; is held up to honour
for that &ldquo;having a field,&rdquo; he &ldquo;sold it, and brought
the money, and laid it at the apostles&rsquo; feet.&rdquo; Then comes
the story of Ananias and Sapphira, who, or at least the former, have
ever since supplied Christendom with its standing name for the
fraudulent liar. The sin of Ananias consisted in his not having given
the apostles the <i>whole</i> price of a possession he had voluntarily
sold for behoof of the community. There could be no more striking
instance of the power of ecclesiastical ethic to paralyse the general
moral sense. Ananias in the legend was giving liberally, but not
liberally enough to satisfy the apostle, who accordingly denounces him
as sinning against the Holy Ghost,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5306src"
href="#xd23e5306" name="xd23e5306src">4</a> and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>miraculously slays him for his crime. One might
have supposed that no Christian reader, remembering that the
ultra-righteous apostle, in the previous sacrosanct record, had just
before been represented as basely denying his Lord, could fail to be
struck with shame and horror by the savage recital. But of such shame
and horror I cannot recall one Christian avowal. And we are to remember
that the devout recipients of that recital are assumed to have been the
ideal Christian converts.</p>
<p class="par">Soon the twelve are made to explain (vi, 2&ndash;4) to
the growing &ldquo;multitude of the disciples&rdquo; that &ldquo;it is
not fit that we should forsake the word of God, and serve tables. Look
ye out ... seven men of good report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom,
whom we may appoint over this business. But we will continue stedfastly
in prayer, and in the ministry of the word.&rdquo; From the date of
that writing the apostle and his successors could claim to be worthy of
their hire, though they had long to squabble for it. In the early
Jesuist additions to the <span class="sc">Teaching</span> we see how
the issue was raised. At first (xi) there is a succession of wandering
apostles or &ldquo;prophets.&rdquo; Every apostle is to be received
&ldquo;as the Lord; but he shall not remain [except for?] one day; if
however there be need, then the next [day]; but if he remain three
days, he is a false prophet. But when the apostle departeth, let him
take nothing except bread enough till he lodge [again]; but if he ask
money, he is a false prophet.&rdquo; That is the first stage, probably
quite Judaic.</p>
<p class="par">The next section (xii) still adheres broadly to the same
view. Every entrant must work for his living. &ldquo;If he will not act
according to this, he is a Christmonger (<span class="trans" title=
"christemporos"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&chi;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#8051;&mu;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&#8057;&sigmaf;</span></span>).&rdquo;
Evidently there were already Christmongers. But in chapter xiii the
primitive stage has been passed, and there is systematic enactment of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>economic provision for the installed prophet or
teacher as such:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">But every true prophet who will <i>settle</i>
among you is worthy of his food. Likewise a true teacher, he also is
worthy, like the workman, of his food. Every first-fruit, then, of the
produce of wine-press and threshing-floor, of oxen and of sheep, thou
shalt take and give to the prophets; for they are your high-priests.
But if ye have no prophet, give [it] to the poor. If thou makest a
baking of bread, take the first [of it] and give according to the
commandment. In like manner when thou openest a jar of wine or oil,
take the first [of it] and give to the prophets; and of money and
clothing and every possession, take the first, as may seem right to
thee, and give according to the commandment.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">This economic development, too, may have been Jewish, as
it was heathen.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5340src" href="#xd23e5340"
name="xd23e5340src">5</a> It is certainly also Christian. The
&ldquo;prophets&rdquo; are represented in the Acts (<a class=

&ldquo;teachers.&rdquo; That passage is obviously post-Pauline, if we
are to think of Paul as spending only a few years in his eastern
propaganda. But the prophets are ostensibly numerous in the earliest
days of the church,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5351src" href=
"#xd23e5351" name="xd23e5351src">6</a> and seem to have subsisted
alongside of &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; at the outset. All along they must
have found some subsistence: in time they are
&ldquo;established.&rdquo; The eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth
sections of the <span class="sc">Teaching</span>, which are our best
evidence of the progression, show a gradual triumph of the economic
factor, registering itself in the additions. The fifteenth section
divides in two parts, an economic and an ethical, the economic coming

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It was for a community thus supporting various classes

<i>Organization</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Organization, which in our days has become
&ldquo;a word to conjure with,&rdquo; is no new factor in human life.
It is the secret of survival for communities and institutions; and the
survival of Christism in its competition with other cults must be
traced mainly to the early process of adaptation. That, however, takes
place in terms of three concurrent factors: (1) the appeal made by the
cult which is the ground of association; (2) the practice of the
community as regards the relations of members; (3) the administration,
as regards propaganda, expansion and co-ordination of groups. And it is
through primary adaptations in respect of the first and second, with a
constant stimulus from the third, that the Christian Church can be seen
to have succeeded in the struggle for existence. That is to say, it is
in the element in which conscious organization is most prominent as
distinct from usage or tradition that the determining influence chiefly
lies.</p>
<p class="par">The writer who in England was the first to take a
comparatively scientific view of church organization from the
ecclesiastical side, the late Dr. Edwin Hatch, puts in the forefront of
his survey &ldquo;the preliminary assumption that, as matter of
historical research, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href=
"#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>facts of ecclesiastical history do
not differ in kind from the facts of civil history.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5390src" href="#xd23e5390" name="xd23e5390src">7</a>
For those who see in the religion itself a processus of natural social
history, this assumption is a matter of course; but the ecclesiastical
recognition of the fact is an important step; and the churchman&rsquo;s
analysis of the process is doubly serviceable in that he keeps the
study avowedly separate from that of the evolution of doctrine. What he
could not have supplied on scientific lines without falling into
heresy, the rationalist can supply for himself.</p>
<p class="par">As our historian recognizes, the Christian movement in
the Eastern Empire had from the outset a strong basis in the democratic
spirit which it derived alike from Jewish and from Hellenistic example.
In the day of universal autocracy, social life lay more and more in the
principles of voluntary association; and the first Christian churches
were but instances of an impulse seen in operation on all sides. In the
Jewish environment, the synagogue; in the Hellenistic the <i lang=
"la">ecclesia</i> or private association, were everywhere in evidence.
Greek religious associations&mdash;<i lang="grc-latn">thiasoi, eranoi,
orgeones</i>&mdash;were but types of the prevailing impetus to find in
voluntary organized groups a substitute for the democratic life of the
past.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5404src" href="#xd23e5404" name=
"xd23e5404src">8</a> Whereas the older associations for the promotion
of special worships were limited to male free citizens, the new
admitted foreigners, slaves, and women. Besides religious associations
there were a multitude of others which had the double aspect of clubs
and friendly societies; trade guilds existed &ldquo;among almost every
kind of workmen in almost every town in the empire:&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5409src" href="#xd23e5409" name="xd23e5409src">9</a>
and burial clubs, dining clubs, financial societies, and friendly
societies met other social needs. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Almost every society, however, had its tutelary
divinity, &ldquo;in the same way as at the present day similar
associations on the continent of Europe&rdquo;&mdash;as in England
before the Reformation&mdash;&ldquo;invoke the name of a patron saint;
and their meetings were sometimes called by a name which was afterwards
consecrated to Christian uses&mdash;that of a &lsquo;sacred
synod.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5417src" href=
"#xd23e5417" name="xd23e5417src">10</a> In many of them &ldquo;religion
was, beyond this, the basis and bond of union.... Then, as now, many
men had two religions, that which they professed and that which they
believed; for the former there were temples and State officials and
public sacrifices; for the latter there were associations; and in these
associations, as is shown from extant inscriptions, divinities whom the
State ignored had their priests, their chapels, and their
ritual.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5425src" href="#xd23e5425"
name="xd23e5425src">11</a></p>
<p class="par">The Christists, then, when they began to form groups,
were doing what a swarm of other movements did. Their <i lang=
"la">ecclesi&aelig;</i> were called by a pagan name, as were the Jewish
synagogues. Two things it behoved them to do if they were collectively
to gain ground and outlive or out-top the rest: they must multiply in
membership, and they must co-ordinate their groups; and both things
they did on lines of common action. Membership was from the first
promoted by the simplest of all methods, systematic almsgiving to poor
adherents; a practice long before initiated by the Jewish synagogues
and to this day fixed among them. Given the basis of free association,
the inculcated duty of almsgiving, the eastern belief in its saving
virtue,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5435src" href="#xd23e5435" name=
"xd23e5435src">12</a> and the special Christian belief in the speedy
end of the world, the problem of membership was early solved. The poor,
helped one day, would themselves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165"
href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>help the next, as is their
human way in all ages; and in an age of general poverty, the result of
an autocratic fiscal system in the Empire as afterwards in the Turkish
Empire which in the East took its place, such mutual sympathy
constituted a broad social basis of corporate existence.</p>
<p class="par">For our ecclesiastical historian, the poverty is the
main determinant on the side of early organization. With a note of
profound pessimism, which alternates strangely with passages of
professional eulogy of the Church, he notes that pauperism and
philanthropy were going hand in hand already throughout the Empire
before the advent of Christianity, rich men and municipalities
proclaiming an &ldquo;almost Christian sentiment&rdquo; on the subject.
&ldquo;The instinct of benevolence was fairly roused. And yet to the
mass of men life was hardly worth living. It tended to become a
despair.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5445src" href="#xd23e5445"
name="xd23e5445src">13</a> And he claims that the Christian practice of
almsgiving&mdash;which he knows to have been warmly inculcated among
the Jews, as it has always been in Eastern countries&mdash;was one of
the conservative forces that &ldquo;arrested decay. They have prevented
the disintegration, and possibly the disintegration by a vast and
ruinous convulsion, of the social fabric. Of those forces the primitive
bishops and deacons were the channels and the ministers.... They
bridged over the widening interval between class and class. They
lessened to the individual soul the weight of that awful sadness of
which, then as now, to the mass of men, life was the synonym and the
sum.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5448src" href="#xd23e5448" name=
"xd23e5448src">14</a></p>
<p class="par">The generalization as to the widening of the interval
between classes is hardly borne out by the evidence; and the pessimism
of the last sentence partly defeats the argument, by putting the life
of the early Christian period <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"
href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>on the same general level
with that of to-day and of all the time between. The true summary would
be that in that age the springs of social life were lamed by the
suppression of all national existence; that the rule of Rome tended to
general impoverishment in respect of a vicious system of taxation; and
that the subject peoples, deprived of the old impulses to collective
energy, at once turned more and more to private association and became
ready to believe in a coming &ldquo;end of the world&rdquo; which in
some way was to mean a new life. And as the Church&rsquo;s doctrine was
pre-eminently one of salvation in that new life, it behoved it in every
way to resort to propaganda while maintaining the eleemosynary system
which gave it a broad basis of membership. Thus the organization which
controlled the simple financial system must also have regard to the
spread of doctrine. And for the means of spreading doctrine, again, as
we have already noted, the cue was obviously given by Judaism, which
stood out from all religious systems in the Roman world as a religion
of Sacred Books. Sacred Books of its own the Jesuist movement must have
if it was to hold its own against the prestige of the Jewish Bible. The
production of Sacred Books, then, was a task which devolved upon the
organizers of the Christian <i lang="la">ecclesi&aelig;</i> throughout
the Eastern Empire, equally with the task of co-ordination, of which,
in fact, it was a main part. A common religious literature was the
basis of Jewish cohesion. Only by means of a common religious
literature could Christism cohere.</p>
<p class="par">No literature, indeed, could avert schism. Schism and
strife are among the first notes sounded in the epistles; and a
religion which aimed at dogmatic teaching, as against the purely
liturgical practice of the old pagan cults, was bound to multiply them.
Judaism itself was divided into antagonistic groups of Pharisees,
Sadducees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>and Scribes, to say nothing of the Zealots, the
Essenes, and other diverging groups. But sects do not destroy a
religion any more than parties destroy a State; and the way of success
for Christism was a way which, while it involved a multiplication of
schism so long as the voluntary basis remained, made a growing
aggregate which was at least a unity as having a special creed,
distinct from all competing with it.</p>
<p class="par">Thus the Christian movement was doubly a copy and
competitor of Judaism, upon whose books it primarily founded. As the
dispersed Jewish synagogues were co-ordinated from Jerusalem by the
High Priest, and later from Tiberias by the Patriarch, by means of
Twelve Apostles and possibly by a subordinate grade of seventy-two
collectors who brought in the contributions of the faithful scattered
among the Gentiles, so the Jesuists, beginning with an organization
centred in Jerusalem and likewise aiming at the collection of funds for
which almsgiving in Jerusalem was the appealing pretext, were bound
after the fall of the Temple to aim at a centralization or
centralizations of their own. A literature became more and more
necessary if the new faith was to extend. That was the way at once to
glorify the new Hero-God and to multiply his devotees. And it would
seem to have been from the starting-point of the Jewish <span class=
"sc">Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</span> that the new departure on
one line was made.</p>
<p class="par">To say who, or what class in the new organization, began
the evolution, seems impossible in the present state of our knowledge.
The point at which the Christist organization in course of time most
noticeably diverges from the Jewish model is in the creation and
aggrandisement of the <i>episcopos</i>, the bishop, a title and a
function borrowed from the pagan societies. These had officials called
<i>epimel&#275;tai</i> (superintendents) and <i>episcopoi</i>, whose
function it was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"
name="pb168">168</a>]</span>to receive funds and dispense
alms.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5482src" href="#xd23e5482" name=
"xd23e5482src">15</a> The early Christists adopted the latter title,
and constituted for each group a single official so named, who as
president of the assembly received the offerings of donors and was
personally responsible for their distribution. This is not the place to
trace the effects of the institution in the general development of the
churches. It must suffice to note that while in their <i>presbyters</i>
these preserved the democratic element which they had derived from
Judaism and which gave them their social foundation, their creation of
a supreme administrator, whose interest it was always to increase the
influence of his church by increasing his own, gave them a special
source of strength in comparison with the Judaic system.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5489src" href="#xd23e5489" name=
"xd23e5489src">16</a></p>
<p class="par">For the dispersed Jews, held by a racial tie,
association was a matter of course. Marked off by religion if not by
aspect from Gentiles everywhere, they were a community within the
Gentile community. For the first Jesuists, association was not thus a
matter of course all round. For the slaves, seeking friendship, and the
poor, seeking help, it may have been; but the more prosperous were for
that very reason less spontaneously attracted. The fundamental tie was
the so-called &ldquo;Eucharist,&rdquo; which at first, in varying
forms, was probably only an annual rite: the <i>agapae</i> or love
feasts were common to the multitude of pagan associations. Accordingly
many adherents tended to &ldquo;forsake the assembling of themselves
together,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5502src" href="#xd23e5502"
name="xd23e5502src">17</a> and it was plainly the function of the
bishop to act upon these. Not only the Epistle to the Hebrews and that
of Jude but those of Barnabas and Ignatius, and <span class="sc">The
Shepherd</span> of Hermas, anxiously or sternly urge the duty of
regular meeting. Addresses by bishops and &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; would
be natural means of promoting the end.</p>
<p class="par">Who then produced the literature? Once more, there
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>is no evidence. If any of the Epistles might at
first sight seem &ldquo;genuine,&rdquo; they are those ascribed to
James and Jude, essentially Judaic or Judaistic documents, especially
the former, in which (ii, 1) the cumbrous formula &ldquo;the faith of
our Lord Jesus Christ of glory&rdquo; exhibits a Christian
interpolation. It is essentially in the spirit of the <span class=
"sc">Teaching</span>, a counsel of right living, calling for works in
opposition to the new doctrine that faith is the one thing needful, and
sounding the Ebionitic note (v, 1): &ldquo;Go to now, ye rich, weep and
howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.&rdquo; But save for
the interpolation and the naming of Jesus Christ in the sentence of
preamble, there is no specific Jesuist or Christist teaching whatever.
If this document was current among the Jesuists, it was borrowed from a
Jewish author who had at most one special item of belief in common with
them, that of &ldquo;the coming [<i>or</i> presence] of the Lord&rdquo;
(v. 7, 8); and here there is no certainty that &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;
meant for the writer the Christ.</p>
<p class="par">Once more, then, we turn for our first clue to the
Judaic <span class="sc">Teaching</span>, which on its face exhibits the
gradual accretion of Jesuist elements, beginning with an Ebionitic
mention of the &ldquo;Servant&rdquo; Jesus, and proceeding step by step
from a stage in which wandering &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; or
&ldquo;prophets&rdquo; must subsist from hand to mouth and from day to
day, to one in which settled prophets are supported by first fruits,
and yet a further one in which bishops and deacons appear to administer
while prophets and teachers continue to teach. And as the
&ldquo;prophets&rdquo; constitute a class which in the third century
has disappeared from the church, as if its work were done; and as they
bear the name given to the chief producers of the sacred literature of
Judaism, it would seem to be the natural surmise that they were the
primary producers of special literature for the early Christian
churches. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Evidently the <span class="sc">Teaching</span>
(<i>Didach&ecirc;</i>) <span class="sc">of the Twelve Apostles</span>
was humbly used by some of the early Jesuists as an authoritative
Jewish manual which supplied them with their rule of conduct, they only
later supplying (c. ix) their special rite of the
&ldquo;Eucharist&rdquo; of wine and broken<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5549src" href="#xd23e5549" name="xd23e5549src">1</a> bread, and
vaguely mentioning &ldquo;the life and knowledge which thou hast made
known to us by Jesus thy Servant.&rdquo; <i>There is no mention of
crucifixion, no naming of Jesus as Messiah.</i> We are confronted with
a primary Judaic Jesuism which is not that of the gospels, nor that of
the Paulines, nor that of the Acts, though it agrees with the latter in
calling Jesus the Servant of the Lord. It is even of older type than
Ebionism; for the Ebionites carried their cult of poverty and
asceticism to the point of using water instead of wine in the
Eucharist;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5562src" href="#xd23e5562" name=
"xd23e5562src">2</a> whereas the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i> specifies wine,
the older practice. The cup of the Eucharist is &ldquo;the holy wine of
David thy servant, which thou hast made known to us through Jesus thy
servant&rdquo;; and the thanks which follow (c. 10) are to the holy
Father &ldquo;for thy holy name, which thou hast caused to dwell in our
hearts, and for the knowledge and faith and immortality which thou hast
made known to us through Jesus thy servant.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It is quite clear that in this form of Jesuism, visibly
early as compared with that set forth in the gospels and the Acts, we
have something different from that in its derivation. The Eucharist,
here so called ostensibly for the first time, is only inferribly
derived from a sacrament of the body and blood of the sacrificed Jesus.
<i lang="la">Eucharistia</i> means thanksgiving or thank-offering, and
this ritual-meal is intelligibly so named. Applied, as by Justin Martyr
and later Fathers, to the sacrificial sacrament of the gospels and the
epistles, the name is a false description: yet the false description
becomes canonical. The licit inference appears to be that the cult of a
Jesus who outside of Judaism was a Sacrificed Saviour-God had here,
under Judaic control, been presented as that of a Hero-Jesus, connected
like Dionysos with the gift of the vine, and associated with a ritual
meal of thanksgiving to Yahweh, whose &ldquo;servant&rdquo; he is.</p>
<p class="par">Taking the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i> as a stage in the
Christian evolution, we further infer that the conception and name of a
&ldquo;Eucharist&rdquo; was thence imposed on another and older species
of ritual-meal, in which the Jesus is slain as a sacrifice and
commemorated in a sacrificial sacrament. The more Judaic form of the
cult absorbs an older and non-Judaic form, forced to the front by a
death-story which gives to its sacrament a higher virtue for the
devotee. It is a case of competition of cult forms for survival, the
weaker being superseded. And as the sacrament, so the Jesus, is
developed on other lines. He of the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i> is neither Son
of God nor Saviour, as he is not the Messiah, though he has somehow
conveyed &ldquo;knowledge and faith and immortality.&rdquo; What the
<i>Didach&ecirc;</i> does is to begin the process of a doctrinal and
ethical teaching which coalesces with that of evolving the God.</p>
<p class="par">In the eighth section, the &ldquo;Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer&rdquo; is introduced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href=
"#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>with the formula &ldquo;Nor pray
ye like the hypocrites, but as the Lord commanded in his gospel.&rdquo;
Now &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; has in every previous mention clearly meant,
not Jesus, who is mentioned solely in the &ldquo;servant&rdquo;
passages, but &ldquo;God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Father,&rdquo; the Jewish
deity. Either, then, &ldquo;the Lord ... in his gospel&rdquo; refers to
some &ldquo;gospel&rdquo; of Yahweh or, as is highly probable, the
whole clause is a late interpolation. This is the more likely because
the seventh section, prescribing baptism in the name of &ldquo;the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; is flagrantly
interpolated. That being so, the provision at the end of c. 9, that no
one shall partake of the Eucharist except those baptized in the name of
the Lord, must be held to be also a late interpolation. Thus the
document has been manipulated to some extent even in its early
portions. The only other mentions of the gospel are in chapters 11 and
15, which follow after the &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; of the tenth, and
represent the progressive provisions for the apostles and prophets of
the growing church. The introduction of Jesuism in chapters 9 and 10 is
pre-gospel.</p>
<p class="par">This will be disputed only by those who, like the first
American and German editors, cannot see that the first five or six
sections are purely Judaic. After Dr. Charles Taylor and other English
editors did so, coinciding with an early suggestion of M.
Massebieau,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5594src" href="#xd23e5594" name=
"xd23e5594src">3</a> the rest have mostly come into line; and even the
American editors at the outset saw that the Epistle of Barnabas, which
has so much of the matter of the <span class="sc">Teaching</span>, is
the later and not the earlier document. Thus the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer
takes its place as originally a Jewish and not a Christian document;
and the passages in the early chapters which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>coincide with the Sermon on the Mount are
equally Jewish.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5602src" href="#xd23e5602"
name="xd23e5602src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">We can now understand the tradition that Matthew, of
which the present opening chapters are so plainly late, was the first
of the gospels, and was primarily a collection of <i>logia</i>. But the
<i>logia</i> were in the terms of the case not <i>logia Iesou</i> at
all, being but a compilation of Jewish dicta on the lines of the
<span class="sc">Teaching</span>, and, as regards the form of
beatitude, probably an imitation of other Jewish literature as exampled
in the &ldquo;Slavonic <span class="sc">Enoch</span>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5623src" href="#xd23e5623" name=
"xd23e5623src">5</a></p>
<p class="par">It must be repeated, however, that the ninth and tenth
sections of the <span class="sc">Teaching</span> are not to be taken as
giving us &ldquo;the&rdquo; original Jesus of the Jesuist movement. We
have posited, with Professor Smith, a &ldquo;multifocal&rdquo;
movement; and concerning the Jesus here given we can only say that the
document tells of the primary connection of the Jesus-Name with a
non-sacrificial Eucharist. Whether the name stood historically for
Joshua or for the Jesus of Zechariah, or for yet another, it is
impossible to pronounce. What is clear is that it does <i>not</i> point
to the Jesus of the gospels. When the Jesus-sections of the
<span class="sc">Teaching</span> were penned, the gospels were yet to
come; and the crucified Saviour-God of Paul was not preached, though
his myth was certainly current somewhere.</p>

Apocalypse</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The &ldquo;Revelation of John the
Theologian&rdquo; is also, in respect of much of its matter,
pre-gospel, and even in its later elements independent of the gospels.
It is noteworthy that the latest professional criticism has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>after infinite fumbling come (without
acknowledging him) to the view of Dupuis that the episode of the woman
and the child and the dragon belong to sun-myth;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5650src" href="#xd23e5650" name="xd23e5650src">6</a> and the
exegetes would probably save themselves a good deal of further guessing
by contemplating Dupuis&rsquo;s solution that the special details are
simply derived from an ancient planisphere or fuller zodiac, in which
the woman and the dragon and the hydra are prominent figures.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5659src" href="#xd23e5659" name="xd23e5659src">7</a>
It is in any case particularly important to realize that this palpably
mythical conception of a Jesus Christ, figured as &ldquo;the
Lamb,&rdquo; evidently with a zodiacal reference, is found in one of
the earliest documents of the cult, outside of the gospels.</p>
<p class="par">In these, as we have seen, the original God-Man is
progressively humanized from the hieratic figure of the opening
chapters of Mark, through Matthew and Luke, till in the fourth, which
declares him Logos and premundane, he has close personal friends and
(ostensibly) weeps for the death of one. But not even the thoughtless
criticism which professes to find a recognizable human figure in Mark
can pretend to find one in Revelation. There, admittedly on Jewish
bases, there is limned an unearthly figure, who has been
&ldquo;pierced,&rdquo; we are not told where; who has the keys of death
and Hades, and carries on his right hand seven stars; and has eyes like
a flame of fire and feet like unto burnished brass. With this
pre-Christian apparatus, which on the astrological side goes back to
Persia and Babylon, there is carried on a fierce polemic against
certain of the &ldquo;seven <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href=
"#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>churches,&rdquo; the sect of the
Nicolaitans, and &ldquo;them which say they are Jews and are not, but
are a synagogue of Satan.&rdquo; The churches named are not those of
the Acts and the Pauline epistles: Jerusalem and Antioch are not named,
though Ephesus is. Jewish and pre-Jewish myth and doctrine overlay the
Jesuist, which at many points is visibly a mere verbal interpolation;
so that the question arises whether even the seven churches are
primarily Christian or Jewish.</p>
<p class="par">If &ldquo;Babylon&rdquo; stands for Rome, it is but an
adaptation of an older polemic; for Babylon is declared to have
actually fallen, before it is announced that she &ldquo;shall be cast
down.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5680src" href="#xd23e5680"
name="xd23e5680src">8</a> The eleventh chapter dilates on the Jewish
temple; again and again we listen to a purely Jewish declamation over
Jewish woes; the four-and-twenty elders and the Lamb &ldquo;as though
it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the
seven Spirits of God,&rdquo; are of Babylonian and Persian derivation;
and the &ldquo;second death&rdquo; is Egyptian. In the new Jerusalem,
&ldquo;coming down out of heaven,&rdquo; twelve angels are at the
gates, which bear the names of the twelve tribes; and the &ldquo;twelve
apostles of the Lamb&rdquo; are represented only by &ldquo;twelve
basement courses&rdquo; of the wall.</p>
<p class="par">How much such a document stood for in the early
building-up of the cult it is impossible to gather from the records,
which indicate that it was long regarded askance by the gospel-reading
and epistle-reading churches. But it gives a definite proof that the
cult had roots wholly unlike those indicated in the
&ldquo;catholic&rdquo; tradition, and wholly incompatible with the
beginnings set out in the gospels and the Acts. <span class=

<i>Epistles</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The outstanding problem in regard to the Epistles
in the mass is that while criticism is more and more pressing them out
of the &ldquo;apostolic&rdquo; period into the second century, they
show practically no knowledge of the gospels. As little do they show
any trace of the &ldquo;personality&rdquo; of the Founder, which is
posited by the biographical school as the ground for the resurrection
myth. Of Jesus as a remarkable personality there is no glimpse in the
whole literature; and it must be a relief for the defenders of his
historicity to be invited to pronounce both James and Jude
pseudepigraphic documents, the former written with direct polemic
reference to the Pauline doctrine of faith.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5701src" href="#xd23e5701" name="xd23e5701src">9</a> The puzzle
is to conceive how, on that view, the document can still remain so
destitute of Jesuist colouring.</p>
<p class="par">Save for the two namings of Jesus (i, 1; ii, 1) at the
beginnings of chapters, there is no trace of Jesuine doctrine; the
epistle is addressed to &ldquo;the twelve tribes of the
Dispersion&rdquo;; and there is a reference (ii, 2) to &ldquo;your
<span class="corr" id="xd23e5711" title=
"Source: syngaogue">synagogue</span>,&rdquo; not to &ldquo;your
ecclesia.&rdquo; When therefore we note the extremely suspicious
character of the second naming of Jesus, &ldquo;our Lord Jesus Christ
of glory,&rdquo; we are doubly entitled to diagnose interpolation; and
the first naming at once comes under suspicion. It is not surprising
therefore that such a critic as Spitta pronounces the epistle a Jewish
document.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5714src" href="#xd23e5714" name=
"xd23e5714src">10</a> Even if it were true, then, that the
eschatological matter has a gospel colouring, that would carry us no
further than a surmise that the Jewish document had been slightly
developed for Jesuine purposes. And this may be the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span>solution as to the anti-Pauline element. An
originally Jewish document may have been used by a
Jud&aelig;o-Christian to carry an attack on a doctrine of Gentilizing
Christism. The residual fact is that a section of the Jesuist movement
in the second century was satisfied with a quasi-apostolic document
which has no hint of the teaching of a historical Jesus. Naturally it
soon passed into &ldquo;catholic&rdquo; disfavour.</p>
<p class="par">But the remaining epistles differ historically from this
only in respect of their asseveration of a crucified Christ, by faith
in whom men are saved. They too are devoid of biographical data.
Neither parable nor miracle, doctrine nor deed, family history nor
birthplace, of the Founder is ever mentioned in the epistolary
literature, any more than in the Apocalypse or the
<i>Didach&ecirc;</i>. And yet the mass of the epistles are being, as
aforesaid, more and more pressed upon by criticism as pseudepigraphic.
Second Peter was always in dispute; and First Peter has few save
traditionalist supporters. If First John is to be bracketed with the
fourth gospel, it is dismissed with that as outside the synoptic
tradition: and the second and third epistles are simply dropped as
spurious. Hebrews is anonymous, though our Revisers saw fit to retain
its false title; and that epistle too is utterly devoid of testimony to
a historical Jesus. It tells simply of a human sacrifice, in which the
victim &ldquo;suffered without the gate,&rdquo; in accordance with the
regular sacrificial practice. Late or early, then, the epistles give no
support to the gospels&mdash;or, at least, to the biographical theory
founded on these.</p>
<p class="par">It is thus quite unnecessary to argue here the
interesting question of the genuineness of any of the Pauline epistles.
Long ago, nine were given up by the T&uuml;bingen school, and four only
claimed to be genuine. Remembering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178"
href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>the datum of Eusebius that
Paul personally penned &ldquo;only a few very short&rdquo; epistles,
though specially gifted in the matter of style, we are not unprepared
to find even these called in question. And latterly the Dutch school
whose work culminated in Van Manen has built up an impressive
case<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5728src" href="#xd23e5728" name=
"xd23e5728src">11</a> for the rejection of the whole mass, the supreme
&ldquo;four&rdquo; included; and the defence so far made by the
traditionalists is the reverse of impressive.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5739src" href="#xd23e5739" name="xd23e5739src">12</a> The ablest
counter-criticism comes from other men of the left wing, as Schmiedel,
who makes havoc of the Acts.</p>
<p class="par">From the point of view of the historical as
distinguished from the documentary critic, all that need here be said
on the issue is that the negative case may have to be restated if there
is faced the hypothesis that the Jesuine movement was of comparatively
old standing, and of some degree of development, when Paul came on the
scene. Van Manen assumes the substantial historicity not only of Jesus
but of the Jesuine movement as set forth in the Gospels; and whereas he
found it hard to make that assumption on the view that any of the
Paulines was genuine, he had no difficulty about it when he relegated
them all to the second century. It should be asked, then, whether the
view that the Jesus-cult is &ldquo;pre-Christian&rdquo; might not
re-open the case for some of the Paulines.</p>
<p class="par">Having put that caveat, the historical critic has simply
to consider the question of the historicity of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>Jesus in relation to the Paulines from both
points of view, asking what evidence they can be supposed to yield
either on the view of the genuineness of some or on that of the
spuriousness of all. And the outcome is that on neither view do they
tell of a historical Jesus. If &ldquo;the four&rdquo; are genuine,
Paul, declared to be so near the influence of the
&ldquo;personality&rdquo; of Jesus, not only shows no trace of
impression from it but expressly puts aside the question. In the
Epistle to the Galatians he declares that he had not learned his gospel
from the other apostles but received it by special revelation, actually
avoiding intercourse with the other apostles apart from Peter&mdash;a
proposition certainly savouring strongly of post-Pauline dialectic, as
does the text (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Cor%205:16">2 Cor. v,
16</a>): &ldquo;Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet
now we know [him so] no more.&rdquo; Instead then of the Paulines, on
the view of their genuineness, confirming the conception of a
remarkable personality which had profoundly impressed those who came in
contact with it, they radically and unmanageably conflict with that
conception. So far Van Manen is justified.</p>
<p class="par">If on the other hand we accept the strongly supported
thesis that they are all pseudepigraphic, the historicity of the
gospels is in no way accredited. We reach the view that early in the
second century, when such early gospels as the Matthew and Mark of
Papias may be supposed to have been current, even the devotees who
wrote in Paul&rsquo;s name took no interest in the human personality of
Jesus, but were concerned simply about the religious significance of
his death. The passages in First Corinthians (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011:23">xi,
23</a> <i>sq.</i>; <a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:3">xv, 3</a>
<i>sq.</i>) which deal with the Supper and the Resurrection expressly
repudiate knowledge of the gospels; the first claiming to have
&ldquo;received of the Lord&rdquo; the facts retailed, and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span>second, after a similar formula, proffering data
not given in any gospel. And both passages have been demonstrably
interpolated, even if we do not pronounce them, as we are entitled to
do, interpolations as wholes. The first breaks the continuity of an
exhortation as to the proper way of eating the Lord&rsquo;s Supper; the
second is introduced (xv, 1) with a strange profession to
&ldquo;<i>make known</i> unto you the gospel <i>which I preached</i>
unto you.&rdquo; And even the second passage, with its mention of
&ldquo;the twelve,&rdquo; excludes knowledge of the story of Judas;
while the first, at the point at which our revisers translate
&ldquo;was betrayed,&rdquo; really says only &ldquo;delivered up&rdquo;
(<span class="trans" title="paredidoto"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&pi;&alpha;&rho;&epsilon;&delta;&#8055;&delta;&omicron;&tau;&omicron;</span></span>),
which may or may not imply betrayal.</p>
<p class="par">How Van Manen could find in all this any support for the
gospel story in general he never explained; and obviously no support is
given. Historically considered, the epistles undermine the biographical
theory whether we reckon them early or late, genuine or
pseudepigraphic. If early, they discredit completely the notion of a
historical Jesus of impressive personality. If as late as Van Manen
makes them (120&ndash;140) they tell not only of indifference to the
personality of Jesus but of ignorance of the gospel story as we have
it, strongly suggesting that the complete story of the tragedy was yet
unknown, and that only in still later interpolations, made before the
Judas story was current, was it to be indicated.</p>
<p class="par">What is more, the Paulines, like other Epistles, tell of
vital unbelief as to the reality of Jesus. Paul is made to protest that
&ldquo;some among you say that there is no resurrection of the
dead&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2015:12">1 Cor.
xv, 12</a>). These Jesuists, then, held at most only a faith in future
salvation by virtue of the sacrament. So in First John it is implied
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jo%204:2-3">iv,
2&ndash;3</a>) that some of the adherents confess not that Jesus is
come in the flesh, which is declared to be the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>doctrine of &ldquo;the antichrist,&rdquo; a type
of which &ldquo;many&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jo%202:18">ii,
18</a>) have arisen.</p>
<p class="par">We are critically forced, then, to the conclusion that
for a century after the alleged death of the Founder the Jesuist
movement had either no literature whatever save one of primarily Jewish
documents such as the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i> or problematic short Pauline
epistles which have either disappeared or been absorbed in much longer
documents of later date, which in turn still tell of no Jesuine Sacred
Books. All alike exclude the conception of a historical Jesus of
remarkable personality. In the doctrinal quarrels which have already
driven deep furrows in the faith, the personality of Jesus counts for
nothing. In that connection no one cites any teaching of the Master. He
is simply an abstract sacrifice; and even in that aspect he is not
clearly present in the Jewish-Christian <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>. Of his
earthly parentage, domicile, or career, there is not a word. Everything
goes to confirm our hypothesis that the cult is of ancient origin,
rooted in a sacrament which evolved out of a rite of human sacrifice
and connected with non-Jewish as well as Jewish myths which from the
first tended to the deification of the Slain One.</p>
<p class="par">It remains, then, to consider the gospels anew as
compilations made in the second century of (1) previously current
Jewish lore, written and unwritten; (2) doctrinal elements indicated by
the sectarian disputes already active; (3) pseudo-historic elements
justifying Messianic doctrine and practice; and (4) the Mystery-Drama,
now developed under Gentile hands. Upon all this followed (5) the new
theology and new pseudo-biography of the fourth gospel, which was but
another stage in the general process of myth-making. <span class=

<i>Tradition</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">According to the tradition preserved through
Papias (d. <i>circa</i> 165), from &ldquo;John the presbyter,&rdquo;
who is not pretended to have been John the Apostle, the first gospels
were those of Mark, the &ldquo;interpreter&rdquo; of Peter, who set
down in no chronological order the &ldquo;sayings and doings&rdquo; of
the Lord as he had gathered them from Peter; and of Matthew, who wrote
the <i>logia</i> or sayings &ldquo;in the Hebrew
dialect&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5831src" href="#xd23e5831"
name="xd23e5831src">1</a>&mdash;presumably Aramaic. This, the earliest
written tradition concerning the matter embodied in the gospels, is
preserved to us from Papias&rsquo; lost &ldquo;Exposition of the
Dominical<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5837src" href="#xd23e5837" name=
"xd23e5837src">2</a> Oracles&rdquo; (<span class="trans" title=
"Logi&#333;n kyriak&#333;n"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&#8055;&omega;&nu;
&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&#8182;&nu;</span></span>) by
Eusebius. For his own part, Papias professed to set more store by what
he received from Aristion and the Presbyter John and other disciples of
the Lord than by anything &ldquo;out of books.&rdquo; And it chances
that he gave out as a Dominical Oracle<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5849src" href="#xd23e5849" name="xd23e5849src">3</a> thus
certificated a crude picture of millennial marvels which is actually
taken from either the <span class="sc">Apocalypse of Baruch</span>,
which here imitated the <span class="sc">Book of Enoch</span>, or from
an older source.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5861src" href="#xd23e5861"
name="xd23e5861src">4</a> Concerning this utterance of the Lord,
further, Papias narrated a conversation between Jesus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>and
Judas, in which the latter figures as a freethinker, expressing
disbelief in the prediction.</p>
<p class="par">Eusebius, scandalized by such testimony, pronounced
Papias a man of small understanding. But he is the first Christian
authority as to the history of the gospels; and the very fact that he
set less store by them than by oral tradition is evidence that he had
no reason for thinking them more authoritative than the matter that
reached him by word of mouth. It may be that he knew only Greek, and
that he could not read for himself the Aramaic <i>logia</i>, concerning
which he says that &ldquo;every one interpreted them for himself as he
was able.&rdquo; From the <i>logia</i> and the proto-Mark to the first
two synoptics the evolution can only be guessed. No one now claims that
we possess the original documents even in translation. Matthew as it
stands is admittedly not a translation; and Dr. Conybeare, who idly
alleges that I pay no heed to the order of priority of the gospels, and
insists chronically on the general priority of Mark, avows that
&ldquo;Mark, the main source of the first and third evangelists, is
himself no original writer, but a compiler, who pieces together and
edits earlier documents in which his predecessors had written down
popular traditions of the miracles and passion of
Jesus.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5877src" href="#xd23e5877"
name="xd23e5877src">5</a> And he predicates in one part &ldquo;four
stages of documentary development.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5882src" href="#xd23e5882" name="xd23e5882src">6</a> How in this
state of things the existing Mark can be proved to be the main source
of Matthew and Luke is not and cannot be explained. Mark too is
admittedly not a translation from Aramaic; but some of his sources may
have been.</p>
<p class="par">Concerning Matthew, again, the tradition runs that
according to Papias he told a story of a woman accused of many sins
before the Lord; and Eusebius adds, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>apparently on his own
part, that this is contained in the Gospel according to the Hebrews. If
this was the story (now bracketed in R.V.) found only in late copies of
the fourth gospel, the &ldquo;Hebrew&rdquo; gospel contained matter
notably special to itself; and such is the conclusion established by a
collation of all the 33 fragments preserved. &ldquo;We arrive ... at a
Gospel (<i>a</i>) in great part independent of the extant text of our
gospels, and (<i>b</i>) showing no signs of relationship to Mark or
John, but (<i>c</i>) bearing a very marked affinity to Matthew, and
(<i>d</i>) a less constant but still obvious affinity to
Luke.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5904src" href="#xd23e5904"
name="xd23e5904src">7</a> The hypothesis of Nicholson is &ldquo;that
Matthew wrote at <i>different times</i> the canonical gospel and the
gospel according to the Hebrews, or at least that large part of the
latter which runs parallel to the former.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e5913src" href="#xd23e5913" name="xd23e5913src">8</a></p>
<p class="par">On this view, &ldquo;Matthew&rdquo; in one of his
versions deliberately omitted (1) the remarkable story of the woman
taken in adultery; (2) the remarkable story that &ldquo;the mother of
the Lord and his brethren&rdquo; proposed to him that they should all
go and be baptized by John, whereupon he asked &ldquo;Wherein have I
sinned?&rdquo; but added: &ldquo;except perchance this very thing that
I have said in ignorance,&rdquo; and went accordingly; (3) the
statement that at baptism Jesus saw the dove &ldquo;entering into
him&rdquo;; (4) the further item that &ldquo;the entire fountain of the
Holy Spirit descended and rested upon him,&rdquo; addressing him as
&ldquo;My son&rdquo;; and (5) Jesus&rsquo; use of the phrase, &ldquo;My
mother, the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Such a hypothesis, if accepted,
deprives of all meaning the notion of an &ldquo;author&rdquo; of a
document. The only fair inference is that a Greek translation of the
Hebrew gospel was one of the sources of the present Matthew, and that
either <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>(<i>a</i>) many of its details have been
rejected, or (<i>b</i>) that many of the preserved fragments were
additions to the original.</p>
<p class="par">On either view, we must pronounce that the Hebrew
gospel, as exhibited in the fragments, has none of the marks of a real
biographical record. The items of narrative are wholly supernaturalist;
the items of teaching belong to the more advanced Jewish ethic which we
find progressively developed from Matthew to Luke. Once more, the
critical inference is either (<i>a</i>) that the ethically-minded among
the Jesuist &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; set out by putting approved
doctrines in the mouth of the legendary Saviour-God, whereafter
doctrinary episodes were invented for cult purposes, or (<i>b</i>) that
the miraculous life was first pieced out in terms of Old Testament
prophecies held for Messianic. Having regard to the ethical nullity of
the primary evangel posited in the synoptics, the presumption is wholly
against any primary manufacture of new <i>logia</i>. If we take the
Sermon on the Mount as typical, the matter is all
pre-Christian.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5939src" href="#xd23e5939"
name="xd23e5939src">9</a> If we pronounce the <i>method</i> of the
first canonical gospel to be secondary in relation to that of Mark, the
ethical element enters only after the cult has gone a long way, and is
then Jewish matter subsumed, as in the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>.</p>
<p class="par">On bases so laid, there accrue a multitude of
expletions, stones added to the cairn, as: episodes favouring this or
that view of the proper Messianic heredity; of the Messiah&rsquo;s
ascetic or non-ascetic character; of his attitude for or against
Samaritans; of his thaumaturgic principles; of the universality or
selectness of the salvation he brings; of his attitude towards the
Roman power, towards divorce, towards the Scribes and Pharisees, and so
on. Up to the point of the establishment of something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>like
a Canon, the longer the cult lasted, the greater would be the variety
of the teaching. Different views of the descent and character of the
Messiah, put forward by Davidists and non-Davidists, Nazarites and
non-Nazarites, Jews and Samaritans, would all tend to find currency,
and all would tend to find a place in the scroll of some group, whence
they could ill be ousted by any &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; movement. Still
later, definitely anti-Jewish matter is grafted piecemeal by Gentile
adherents: the &ldquo;good Samaritan&rdquo; is an impeachment of Jewish
character; and the legendary apostles are progressively
belittled&mdash;notably so in the mystery play which finally supersedes
the earlier accounts of the Tragedy.</p>
<p class="par">That such a general process actually took place is of
necessity admitted by the biographical school, their problem consisting
in delimiting the amount of tradition which they can plausibly claim as
genuine. From the point of that delimitation they posit a process of
doctrinal and other myth-making. The decision now claimed is that there
is no point of scientific delimitation, and that the process which they
carry forward from an arbitrarily fixed point must logically be carried
backwards.</p>
<p class="par">No more general or more far-reaching result can be
reached by a mere collation and analysis of the synoptics on purely
documentary lines&mdash;a process which has gone on for a century
without even a documentary decision. The conclusion forced upon
Schmiedel, even on the assumption of the historicity of Jesus, that
none of the current theories of gospel-composition can meet the
problem,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5961src" href="#xd23e5961" name=
"xd23e5961src">10</a> becomes part of the case of the myth-theory. The
assumption that a &ldquo;source,&rdquo; once established, gives a
historic foundation, is no more tenable in this than in any other case
of a challenged myth; and the current <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>methods of
establishing sources, rooted as they are in the assumption of
historicity, are often quite arbitrary even when they profess to follow
documentary tests. Nevertheless, the normal pressure of criticism is
seen driving champions of the priority of Mark to the confession that
Mark not only contains late additions but is in itself a secondary or
tertiary document, pointing to an earlier Mark, an <i lang=
"de">Ur-Markus</i>. The primary flaw in the process is the habit of
looking to an author rather than at a compilation; and this habit roots
in the assumption of historicity. At no point can we be sure whether we
are reading a transcript of oral lore or a redaction.</p>
<p class="par">Granting that Mark has pervading peculiarities of
diction which suggest one hand, we are still not entitled to say that
such peculiarities would not be adopted by a redactor. Again, as
against the relative terseness or simplicity of a number of passages
which suggest an earlier form, we have many which by their relative
diffuseness admittedly suggest deliberate elaboration.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e5977src" href="#xd23e5977" name=
"xd23e5977src">11</a> And if we are to ask ourselves what was
<i>likely</i> to be the method of an early evangelist, how shall we
reconcile the &ldquo;in the stern, asleep on the cushion&rdquo; (iv,
38) with the absolute traditionalism and supernaturalism of the first
chapter? John, &ldquo;clothed with camel&rsquo;s hair,&rdquo; is simply
a duplicate of Elijah.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e5989src" href=
"#xd23e5989" name="xd23e5989src">12</a> Is one realistic detail to pass
for personal knowledge when the other is sheer typology? In the opening
chapter, Jesus comes as the promised &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; is prophesied
of by John as the Coming One, is hailed by God from heaven as his
beloved son, sees the heavens rent asunder and the Spirit descending as
a dove, fasts forty days in the wilderness, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>is
ministered to by angels, calls on men to follow him at his first word,
proceeds to give marvellous teaching of which not a word is preserved,
is hailed by a demoniac as the Holy One of God, expels a devil, cures a
fever instantaneously, heals a multitude, casts out many devils, who
know him, goes through the synagogues of Galilee, casting out devils
and preaching, cures a leper instantaneously, commands secrecy, is
disobeyed, and is then flocked-to by more multitudes. And we are
invited to believe that we are reading the biography of a real man, who
always speaks to Jews as one Jew to another, and is &ldquo;not too
bright and good for human nature&rsquo;s daily food.&rdquo; And the
confident champion of this biographical theory assures us that we
&ldquo;need not doubt&rdquo; that Jesus was a &ldquo;successful
exorcist.&rdquo;</p>

<i>Schmiedel&rsquo;s Tests</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Either the first chapter of Mark is primordial
gospel-writing or it is not. If it is, the biographical theory is as
idle as those ridiculed by Socrates in the <span class=
"sc">Ph&aelig;drus</span>. If it is not, upon what does the
biographical theory found? The details of &ldquo;mending their
nets&rdquo; and &ldquo;in the boat with the hired servants&rdquo;?
Professor Schmiedel, conscious of the unreality of such narrative,
falls back upon nine selected texts, seven of them in Mark, which he
claims as &ldquo;pillars&rdquo; of a real biography of Jesus,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6008src" href="#xd23e6008" name=
"xd23e6008src">13</a> on the score that they present him as (<i>a</i>)
flouted in his pretensions or (<i>b</i>) himself disclaiming deity, or
(<i>c</i>) <i>declining</i> to work wonders, or (<i>d</i>) apparently
denying a miracle story, or (<i>e</i>) crying out to God on the cross
that he is forsaken. Now, of all such texts, only <i>b</i> and <i>e</i>
types can have any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189"
name="pb189">189</a>]</span>such evidential force as Schmiedel ascribes
to them.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6051src" href="#xd23e6051" name=
"xd23e6051src">14</a> Type <i>a</i> counts for nothing: not only the
suffering Saviour-Gods but Apollo and Ar&ecirc;s, to say nothing of
Hephaistos, H&ecirc;r&ecirc;, and Aphrodit&ecirc;, are flouted in the
pagan literature which treats them as Gods. If to quote &ldquo;he is
beside himself&rdquo; is to prove historicity, why not quote the taunts
to Jesus in the fourth gospel, nay, the crucifixion itself?</p>
<p class="par">In his able and interesting work on <span class="sc">The
Johannine Writings</span>, Schmiedel carefully developes the thesis
that the Johannine Jesus is an invented figure, conceived from the
first as supernatural; and he puts among other things the notable
proposition that when Jesus weeps it is implied by the evangelist that
he does so not out of human sympathy, but &ldquo;simply because they
[the kinsfolk of Lazarus] did not believe in his power to work
miracles.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6077src" href="#xd23e6077"
name="xd23e6077src">15</a> Assuming for the argument&rsquo;s sake that
this is a true interpretation, we are driven to ask how the thesis
consists with that of the &ldquo;pillar texts.&rdquo; The Johannine
writer starts with a supernatural Jesus, yet not only represents his
attached personal friends as not believing in his power to work
miracles but describes Jesus as weeping because of their unbelief.
Nothing in Mark is for moderns more incongruous with a supernaturalist
view of Jesus, yet Schmiedel sees no difficulty in believing that the
Johannine writer could deliberately frame the incongruity. Why then
should even an original author of Mark be held to regard Jesus as
mortal because in Mark he is flouted, or declines to work wonders, or
is unable to do so at Nazareth? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190"
href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>If one writer can represent
the Eternal Logos as weeping from chagrin, why should not the other
think him God even when he cries out that God has forsaken him? And if,
finally, the cry is held to cite <a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2022:1">Psalm xxii,
1</a>, and to imply the triumphant conclusion of that psalm, what value
has the passage for the critic&rsquo;s purpose?</p>
<p class="par">An unbiassed criticism will of course recognize that the
&ldquo;Jesus wept&rdquo; may be an interpolation, for it is admitted
that the Greek words rendered &ldquo;groaned in the spirit&rdquo; may
mean &ldquo;was moved with indignation in the spirit&rdquo;; and, yet
again, Martha is represented (xi, 22) as avowing the belief that
&ldquo;even now&rdquo; Jesus can raise Lazarus by the power of God.
Nay, the whole story may be an addition, not from the pen of the writer
who makes Jesus God. But equally the incongruities in Mark may come of
interpolation. A fair inference from the characteristics of that
document is that parts of it, notably the first dozen paragraphs,
represent a condensation of previously current matter, while others are
as plainly expansive; and even if these diversely motived sections be
from the same hand, interpolations might be made in either.</p>
<p class="par">In reply to my argument<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6089src" href="#xd23e6089" name="xd23e6089src">16</a> that texts
in which Jesus figures as a natural man would at most represent only
Ebionitic views, Professor Schmiedel puts the perplexing challenge,
concerning the Ebionites:&mdash;&ldquo;Were they not also
<i>worshippers</i> of Jesus as well? Were they really men of such
wickedness that they sought to bring the true humanity of Jesus into
acceptance by <i>falsifying</i> the Gospels? And if they were, was it
in their power to effect this falsification with so great
success?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6100src" href="#xd23e6100"
name="xd23e6100src">17</a> I cannot think that Dr. Schmiedel, who is
invariably <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>candid, has thought out the positions here taken
up. The point that the Ebionites were &ldquo;worshippers&rdquo; of
Jesus is surely fatal to his own thesis. &ldquo;Worshippers&rdquo;
could in their case go on worshipping while maintaining that the
worshipped one was a mortal. Then to assert that he avowed himself a
mortal was not inconsistent with &ldquo;worship.&rdquo; But the
challenge obscures the issue; and it is still more obscured when the
Professor goes on to ask: &ldquo;Had they [the Ebionites] no
predecessors in this view of his person? Must we not suppose that
precisely the earliest Christians, the actual companions of
Jesus&mdash;supposing Him really to have lived&mdash;were their
predecessors?&rdquo; This argument, the Professor must see, has small
bearing on <i>my</i> position.</p>
<p class="par">Three questions are involved, from the mythological
point of view: first, whether actual believers in an alleged divinity
could represent him as flouted, humiliated, or temporarily powerless;
second, whether the Ebionitic view of Jesus can be accounted for
otherwise than as the persistence of a proto-Christian view, arising
among the immediate adherents of a man Jesus; third, whether in the
second century Jesuists of Ebionitic views could invent, and insert in
the gospels, sayings of or concerning Jesus which were meant to
countervail the belief in his divinity.</p>
<p class="par">On the first head, the answer is, as aforesaid, that
throughout all ancient religion we find derogatory views of deity
constantly entertained, at different stages of culture, without any
clear consciousness of incongruity. Yahweh in the Old Testament
&ldquo;repents&rdquo; that he made man; wrangles with Sarah; and is
unable to overcome worshippers of other Gods who have &ldquo;chariots
of iron.&rdquo; Always he is a &ldquo;jealous&rdquo; God; and at a
later stage he is alleged to be consciously thwarted by the Israelites
when they insist on having a king. These are all priest-made
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>stories. Among the early Greeks, the Gods are
still less godlike. In Homer, Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; is almost the only
deity who is treated with habitual reverence: the others are so
constantly satirized, humanized, thwarted, or humiliated, that it is
difficult to associate reverence, in our sense, with the portrayal at
all. The statement of Arno Neumann that &ldquo;it is impossible (here
every historian will agree) for one who worships a hero to think and
speak in such a way as to contradict or essentially modify his own
worship&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6118src" href="#xd23e6118"
name="xd23e6118src">18</a> is an astonishingly uncritical
pronouncement, which simply ignores the main mass of ancient religious
literature.</p>
<p class="par">As regards the Demigods in particular it belongs to the
very nature of the case that they should be at times specially thwarted
and reviled by mortals, since it is their fate to die, albeit to rise
again. If, then, sayings were once invented which fastened human
limitations upon the Divine One for the Jesuists, there was nothing in
the psychology of worshippers on their intellectual plane that should
make them pronounce such sayings forgeries. As we have seen, even in
the fourth gospel, which puts the Divine One higher than ever, he is
made, on Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s own view, to weep for sheer
chagrin.</p>

<p class="par first">More complex is the second question, as to how the
Ebionite view of Jesus emerged. But the answer has already been
indicated in terms of the myth-theory. And the question really cannot
be answered on the biographical view, for the canonical documents give
no hint<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6132src" href="#xd23e6132" name=
"xd23e6132src">19</a> of a persistence of a &ldquo;human&rdquo; view
among the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>early Christists as against a
&ldquo;divine&rdquo; one. The Judaizers are represented equally with
the Paulinists as making Jesus &ldquo;Lord&rdquo;; and it is on the
Paulinist side that we hear of adherents who do not believe in the
resurrection. That is really a divergence from the Judaistic view, for
Jews in general accepted immortality. The moment, however, we put the
hypothesis of a primitive cult of a Saviour-God whose sacrifice in some
way benefits men, and whose Sacrament is the machinery of that benefit,
we account for all the varieties of Jesuism known to us. The cult was
primordially Semitic, a thing on the outskirts of later Judaism, which
would be Judaized in so far as it came under Jewish influence, and then
theologically re-cast for Gentilism by Gentilizing Jews. Thus there
would be Judaistic Ebionites, and Jesuists such as those taught by the
<i>Didach&ecirc;</i>, who would insist on connecting Jesus only with
the Eucharist, making him a subordinate figure, upon whose legend were
slowly grafted moral teachings.</p>
<p class="par">On the other hand there would be non-Jewish Jesuists who
valued the Sacrament as they and others valued those of Paganism,
counting on magical benefits from it (as &ldquo;Catholics&rdquo; in
general did for many centuries), but making light of the Jewish future
life. The one thing in common was the primordial sacrament, at once
Jewish and non-Jewish. For Jews it would easily connect with the belief
in immortality, already much connected with Messianism; for Gentiles
who accepted the former belief, it would be still more easily connected
with a doctrine of future individual salvation. All is broadly
intelligible on the myth-theory. On the biographical theory, the
Jesuists of the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i> are as inexplicable as the Gentile
Jesuists who denied a future life, or the Docetists who denied that
Jesus had come in the flesh. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href=
"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Given such Jewish Jesuists, and given Docetism, the
invention of sayings and episodes in which Jesus is thwarted or
flouted, or disavows Godhood, is perfectly simple. Why Professor
Schmiedel should raise the question of &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; in this
connection I cannot divine. On his own showing, the invention of
sayings and episodes was normal among the Christists in general; and it
affected all of the synoptics. Does he impute &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo;
to the author of the fourth gospel, whom he represents as inventing
discourses and episodes systematically? The Ebionites and Docetists had
as much right to invent as any one else; and once their inventions were
current, they stood a fair chance of being embodied in a gospel or
<span class="corr" id="xd23e6148" title="Source: gospel">gospels</span>
by reason of the general incapacity of the Christists for critical
reflection.</p>
<p class="par">From the biographical standpoint, the Ebionites and
their counterparts the Nazar&aelig;ans are indeed enigmatic. It is
important to have a clear view of what is known as to both
sects.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6153src" href="#xd23e6153" name=
"xd23e6153src">20</a> Origen, noting that the Hebrew name of the former
means &ldquo;the poor,&rdquo; angrily implies that it was given to them
as describing their poverty of mind,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6159src" href="#xd23e6159" name="xd23e6159src">21</a> but leaves
open the rational inference that the name originally described their
chosen social status, which connected with a belief in the speedy end
of the world. In his book <i>Against Celsus</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6167src" href="#xd23e6167" name="xd23e6167src">22</a> he tells
that they include believers in the Virgin Birth and deniers of it. Here
arises the surmise that the former were the <i lang="la">socii
Ebionitarum</i> mentioned by Jerome, who diverged from Judaic views,
and may have been of the general cast of the Nazar&aelig;ans.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6174src" href="#xd23e6174" name=
"xd23e6174src">23</a> These bodies constituted the mass of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>Christians in Jud&aelig;a in the second century.
According to the ecclesiastical tradition, the church of Jerusalem had
withdrawn during the siege to Pella and the neighbouring region beyond
the Jordan. In the reign of Hadrian, after the revolt and destruction
of the Messiah Bar-Cochab, who had attempted to rebuild the temple, the
new Roman city of &AElig;lia Capitolina was built on the ruins of
Jerusalem; and in that no Jews were permitted to dwell. Only those
Christians who renounced Judaic usages, then, could enter; and a number
of such Christians, Jew and Gentile, did so. Others, probably including
both Ebionites and Nazar&aelig;ans, remained at Pella, and these appear
to have furnished the types of heresy discussed by Iren&aelig;us,
Origen, Jerome, and Epiphanius under the head of Ebionism. Those who
set up in Jerusalem were in the way of substituting for
&ldquo;voluntary poverty&rdquo; a propaganda and organization which
meant comfort. Those who stayed behind would represent the primitive
type.</p>
<p class="par">Now, neither Ebionism nor Nazar&aelig;anism offers any
semblance of support for the biographical view. Some Ebionites denied
the Virgin Birth; some, presumably the Nazar&aelig;ans in particular,
accepted it, the latter being described as accepting the canonical
Matthew (or a Hebrew gospel nearly equivalent) with the present opening
chapters, while the Ebionites had a Matthew without them. Of the two
views, neither testified to any impression made by a
&ldquo;personality.&rdquo; The Virgin Birth myth is a reversion to
universal folk-lore by way of enlarging the supernaturalist claim: the
Ebionite denial is either a rejection of all purely human claim for
Jesus or only supernaturalism with a difference, inasmuch as it
inferribly posits a divinization of the Founder either at the moment of
his baptism or at his anointing. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>&ldquo;personality&rdquo; is the one thing never
heard of in the discussion, so far as we can trace it. In one account,
&ldquo;the&rdquo; Ebionites are said to have alleged that Christ became
so because he perfectly fulfilled the law, and that they individually
might become Christs if they fulfilled it as perfectly.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6192src" href="#xd23e6192" name=
"xd23e6192src">24</a> Ebionites and Nazar&aelig;ans between them, on
the biographical view, let slip all knowledge of the Sacred Places, of
Golgotha, of the place of the Sepulchre.</p>
<p class="par">If it be asked how, on the biographical view, there came
to be Jewish Jesuists of the Ebionite type, men such as those described
by Justin Martyr and his Jewish antagonist Trypho, believing in a Jesus
&ldquo;anointed by election&rdquo; who thus became Christ, but adhering
otherwise to Judaic practices,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6200src"
href="#xd23e6200" name="xd23e6200src">25</a> what is the answer? What
idea, what teaching, had Jesus left them? The notion which seems to
have mainly differentiated Ebionites from Jews was simply that Jesus
had been the Messiah, and that his Second Coming would mean the end of
the world. Expectation of the Second Coming would at once promote and
be promoted by poverty, which would thus have a special religious
significance. Nazar&aelig;ans, on the other hand, were latterly marked
by a general opposition to the Pharisees.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6205src" href="#xd23e6205" name="xd23e6205src">26</a> But this
could perfectly well be a simple development of sectarianism. If it be
claimed as a result of the teaching of Jesus, what becomes of the other
teaching as to the love of enemies? Which species of teaching is
supposed to have represented the &ldquo;personality&rdquo;?</p>
<p class="par">Given a general hostility between Nazar&aelig;ans and
Pharisees, the ascription of anti-Pharisaic teachings to the Master
would have been in the ordinary way of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>all Jewish doctrinal
propaganda. In so far as they acclaimed sincerity and denounced
formalism, they are intelligible as part of a general revolt against
Judaic legalism. Nazar&aelig;ans would invent anti-Pharisaic teachings
just as they or &ldquo;Catholics&rdquo; would invent pro-Samaritan
teachings. And in so far as the Ebionites resisted the assimilation of
fresh supernaturalist folk-lore they would tend to put appropriate
sayings in the mouth of the Master just as did the others. They are
expressly charged not only with inventing a saying<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e6212src" href="#xd23e6212" name="xd23e6212src">27</a> in
denunciation of sacrifices, by way of sanctifying their vegetarianism,
which was presumably an aspect of their poverty, but of tampering in
various ways with their texts.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6218src"
href="#xd23e6218" name="xd23e6218src">28</a> This is precisely what the
gospel-makers in general did; and to impeach the Ebionites in
particular is merely to ignore the general procedure. When, then, we
say that Ebionites might well invent a saying in which the Master was
made to repudiate Godhood, and that such a saying might find its way
into many manuscripts, as did other passages from their Hebrew gospel,
it is quite irrelevant to raise questions of &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo;
and of &ldquo;worship.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But it is important here to note the point, insisted on
by Professor W. B. Smith, that most of Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s
&ldquo;pillar&rdquo; texts could be framed with no thought of lowering
the status of Jesus, while some, on the contrary, betray the motive of
discrediting the Jews. The story of Jesus&rsquo; people (<span class=
"trans" title="hoi par&rsquo; autou"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&omicron;&#7985; &pi;&alpha;&rho;&rsquo;
&alpha;&#8016;&tau;&omicron;&#8166;</span></span>, not
&ldquo;friends&rdquo; as in our versions) saying &ldquo;He is beside
himself&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%203:21">Mk. iii,
21</a>), is simply a Gentile intimation that even among his own kin or
associates he was treated as a madman. The idea is exactly the same as
that of the story in the fourth gospel, that &ldquo;the Jews&rdquo;
said he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>&ldquo;had a devil&rdquo; and was a Samaritan.
Similarly &ldquo;tendential&rdquo; is the avowal (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%206:5">Mk. vi, 5</a>)
that at Nazareth the wonder-worker &ldquo;could do no mighty work ...
and he marvelled because of their unbelief.&rdquo; Healing in other
texts is declared to depend on faith; and to call the people of
Nazareth unbelievers was either to explain why Jesus of Nazareth there
had no following or to emphasize the point that the Jews had rejected
the Lord. Such a doctrine, again, as that of <a class="biblink xd23e43"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2012:31">Mt. xii,
31</a>, that blasphemy against the Son of Man was pardonable, was
perfectly natural at a stage at which the cult was seeking eagerly for
converts. Had not Peter, in the legend, denied his Lord with curses,
and Paul persecuted the Church to the death?</p>
<p class="par">In other cases, the bearing of Professor
Schmiedel&rsquo;s texts is so much a matter of arbitrary interpretation
that the debate is otiose; and in yet others there are insoluble
questions of text corruption. The thesis that <i>any</i> text
&ldquo;could not have been invented,&rdquo; and must infer the
existence of a teacher regarded as mortal, is so infirm in logic that
it is not surprising to find it regarded with bitter dislike by the
orthodox, transparently honest as is Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s use of
it.</p>
<p class="par">There is really more force in his argument<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6249src" href="#xd23e6249" name=
"xd23e6249src">29</a> that the predictions of the immediate
re-appearance of the Christ after &ldquo;the tribulation of those
days&rdquo; could not have been invented long after the fall of
Jerusalem, the apparent impulse being rather to minimize them. They may
perfectly well have been predictions made at the approach of danger by
professed prophets. But it does not in the least follow that they were
made by one answering to the description of the gospel Jesus,
predicting his own Second Coming, though some one may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>have
so prophesied. Any Messiah would be &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;; and the
gospel predictions as to false Christs tell of &ldquo;many&rdquo;
Messiahs, every one of whom would speak as &ldquo;the Lord.&rdquo; Such
utterances, after a little while, could no more be discriminated by the
Christists than the certainly pre-Christian sayings put by their
propagandists in the mouth of Jesus. And, once a prediction had been
written down, it lived by the tenure of uncertainty that attached to
all prediction among blind believers. When one
&ldquo;tribulation&rdquo; had apparently passed without a Second
Coming, there was nothing for it but to look forward to the next.</p>
<p class="par">After generations of expectation, the early eschatology
of the Church became a burden to its conductors, inasmuch as
expectation of the end of the world made for disorder, and neglect of
industry; and Second Thessalonians was written to explain away previous
predictions of imminent ending. After the whole mass of such prediction
had been falsified by ages of continuance, there was still no critical
reaction, simply because religious belief excludes the practice of
radical criticism. To this day, orthodoxy has no rational account to
give of the pervading doctrine of the New Testament as to the speedy
end of the world. The biographical school finds in it a measure of
support for its belief in a real Jesus, who shared the delusions of his
age. But as that explanation equally applies to all men in the period,
it gives the biographical view no standing as against the myth-theory.
Christian prophets spoke for &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; just as Jewish
prophets did before them.</p>
<p class="par">In this connection, finally, it has to be noted that
Professor Schmiedel finds an &agrave; priori authenticity in a
prediction in which Jesus claims supernatural status, though the
ostensibly unhistorical character of such <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb200" href="#pb200" name="pb200">200</a>]</span>claims was his avowed
ground for positing the &ldquo;pillar-texts&rdquo; which alone defied
all skepticism. And the formula in both cases is the
same&mdash;&ldquo;it could not have been invented.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6263src" href="#xd23e6263" name=
"xd23e6263src">30</a> The major premiss involved is: &ldquo;No passage
could be invented which would stultify the position of the
believers.&rdquo; But do none of the <i>admitted</i>
inventions<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6272src" href="#xd23e6272" name=
"xd23e6272src">31</a> in the gospels stultify the position of the
believers? The two genealogies do; the anti-Davidic passages stultify
these; the pro-Samaritan teaching stultifies the anti-Samaritan; and so
on through twenty cases of contradiction. M. Loisy, indeed, claims the
pro-Samaritan passage as genuine: does he then admit the anti-Samaritan
to be spurious?</p>
<p class="par">The biographical school cannot have it both ways. The
very fact that they have to oust so many passages on the score of
incompatibility is the complete answer to the plea of &ldquo;genuine
because unsuitable to the purposes of the propaganda.&rdquo; The fact
that a multitude of contradictions are left standing proves simply that
when once an awkward passage was installed it was nearly impossible to
get rid of it; because some copies were always left which retained it;
and in the stage of increasing respect for the written word it was
generally restored. The &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; before Barabbas was at last
ejected only because everybody recoiled from it. Predictions were not
so easily dropped.</p>
<p class="par">On the page on which he claims that Jesus&rsquo;
prediction of his Second Coming could not have been invented, Professor
Schmiedel avows that various passages in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span><a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2024">Mt. xxiv</a>
really belong to &ldquo;a small composition, perhaps Jewish, on the
signs of the end of the world, written shortly before the destruction
of Jerusalem in the year 70.&rdquo; If the one set of passages are
borrowed, why not the other? Was it unlikely that Jewish eschatologists
should predict the coming of the Son of Man at the near end of the
world, and that Jesuists should put the prediction in the mouth of
their Lord and make him say it of himself? The &agrave; priori negative
is quite untenable.</p>
<p class="par">While, then, the argument from unsuitableness is
logically barred for the biographical school by their own frequent
rejection of passages on the score of incompatibility, no aspect or
portion of the New Testament supplies a conclusive argument against the
mythological view. The whole constitutes an intelligible set of growths
from the point of view of the myth-theory; and from no other is the
medley explicable. A biographical theory, having posited a Messiah
whose Messianic claim is a mystery, a Teacher whose alleged teachings
are a mass of conflicting tendencies, and whose disciples admittedly
have no Messianic gospel till after his inexplicable execution,
following on an impossible trial, may make the assumption that by way
of popular myth he was then <span class="corr" id="xd23e6285" title=
"Source: fortuituously">fortuitously</span> deified by Messianist Jews,
and later transformed by other Jews into a Saviour for Gentiles; but
the biographical theory cannot even pretend to account for the
Apocalypse and the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>; and it has to renounce its own
ground principle of &ldquo;personality&rdquo; in order to assimilate
the Epistles. On critical principles, assent must go to the theory
which explains things, reducing the otherwise inexplicable to a natural
evolution on the known lines and bases of hierology. <span class=

Summary</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">We may now bring together in one outline the
series of inductive hypotheses by which we seek to recover the natural
evolution of the historic cult.</p>
<p class="par">1. A primitive Semitic sacramental cult, whose sacrament
centres in a slain Saviour-God, a Jesus, who has assimilated to an
abstraction of the victim annually sacrificed to him&mdash;as in the
case of the cults of Adonis and Attis, both also Asiatic. Of the
sacrificial rite, which in the historic cult is embodied in the Last
Supper and the dramatized story of the Passion, the memory was
preserved in particular by a Jewish rite of Jesus Barabbas, Jesus the
Son of the Father, in which a victim goes through a mock coronation,
ending latterly, perhaps, in a mock-execution, where once there had
been an actual human sacrifice.</p>
<p class="par">2. This cult, with its sacrament, existed sporadically
in various parts of Asia Minor, whence it spread to Greece and Egypt.
Its forms would vary, and under Jewish control the sacrificial
sacrament tended to be reduced to a Eucharist or thankoffering in which
the &ldquo;body and blood&rdquo; are only vaguely, if at all,
reminiscent of the Divine One&rsquo;s death. As a God can always be
developed indefinitely out of a God-Name, and personal Gods are
historically but conceptual aggregates shaped round names or functions,
the adherents of this could proselytize like others. When the Temple of
Jerusalem fell in the year 70, the adherents of the cult there had a
new opportunity and motive, which some of them actively embraced, to
cut loose from the Judaic basis and proclaim a religion of universal
scope, freed from Judaic trammels and claims. Economic motives played a
considerable part in the process.</p>
<p class="par">3. The first tendency of the new Jewish promoters had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>been to develop the Saviour-God of the
sacramental rite (which they may at this stage have adopted in its
&ldquo;pagan&rdquo; form, now taken as canonical) into a Messiah who
was to &ldquo;come again,&rdquo; introducing the Jewish &ldquo;kingdom
of heaven.&rdquo; At a later stage they adopted the rite of baptism,
traditionally associated with John, whom they represented as a
Forerunner of the Messiah who had met, baptized, and acclaimed him,
playing the part assigned by Jewish prophecy to Elias.</p>
<p class="par">4. As time passed on, such a cult would of necessity die
out among Jews, in default of the promised &ldquo;Second Coming.&rdquo;
The connection of the idea of salvation with a future life for all
believers, Jew or Gentile, gave it a new and larger lease of life
throughout the Roman Empire, in every part of which there were
Asiatics. But the Jewish doctrine of the Second Coming remained part of
the developed teaching.</p>
<p class="par">5. Further machinery was accordingly necessary to spread
and sustain the cult; and this was spontaneously provided by (<i>a</i>)
developments of the early and simple propagandist organization, and
(<i>b</i>) provision for the needs of the poor, who among the Gentiles
as among the Jews were the natural adherents of a faith promising the
speedy closing of the earthly scene. Richer sympathizers won esteem by
giving their aid; but the poor, as always, helped each other. The
propaganda included the services of travelling &ldquo;prophets,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; who would be the natural compilers and
inventors of Jesuine lore. The administrative organization, framed on
Hellenistic lines, put more and more power in the hands of the bishop,
whose interest it was to develop his diocese. At first the
&ldquo;prophets&rdquo; and &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; were strictly
peripatetic, being called upon to avoid the appearance of
mercenariness. In course of time they were enabled to settle down,
being systematically provided for. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204"
href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">6. Under the hands of this organization grew up the
Christian Sacred Books, which gave the cult its footing as against, or
rather alongside of, the Jewish, which in the circumstances had an
irresistible and indispensable prestige. Thus on the literary side the
Jewish influence overlaid the non-Jewish, assimilating the outside
elements of scattered Jesuism. The earliest literature is Jewish, as in
the case of the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>, or a Jewish-Jesuist manipulation
of outside Semitic matter, as in the Apocalypse. On these foundations
are laid &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; strata.</p>
<p class="par">7. The <i>Didach&ecirc;</i> (&ldquo;Teaching of the
Twelve Apostles of the Lord&rdquo;) was primarily a brief manual of
monotheistic and moral instruction used by the Twelve Apostles of the
Jewish High Priest. To this, Jesuist matter was gradually added. The
result was that &ldquo;Twelve Apostles&rdquo; became part of the
Christian tradition; and they had ultimately to be imposed on the
gospel record, which obviously had not originally that item.</p>
<p class="par">8. The Epistles represent a polemic development, perhaps
on the basis of a few short Paulines. That of James, which has no
specific &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; colour, represents Judaic resistance,
in the Ebionite temper of &ldquo;voluntary poverty,&rdquo; to the
Gentilizing movement. The Paulines carry on doctrinal debate and
construction against the Judaistic influence. The synoptic gospels,
which in their present forms were developing about the same time,
reflect those struggles primarily in anti-Samaritan and pro-Samaritan
pronouncements, both ascribed to Jesus. Primarily the gospels are
Judaic, and the Gentilizing movement had naturally not employed them.
Paul is made in effect to disclaim their aid. In time they are adopted
and partly turned to anti-Judaic ends.</p>
<p class="par">9. The chief Gentile achievement in the matter is the
development of the primitive sacrament-motive and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>ritual (fundamentally dramatic) into the
mystery-play which is transcribed in the closing chapters of Matthew
and Mark. Previous accounts of the foundation of the Sacrament and the
death of the Lord are now superseded by a vivid though dramatically
brief narrative in which the Jewish people are collectively saddled
with the guilt of his death and the Roman government is crudely and
impossibly exonerated. The apostles in general are made to play a poor
part; one plays an impossible r&ocirc;le of betrayer; and the legendary
Judaizing apostle is made to deny his Master. The whole story is
thoroughly unhistorical, from the triumphal Entry to the quasi-regal
crucifixion; but it embodied the main ritual features of the
traditional human sacrifice, and, there being simply no biographical
record to compete with it, it held its ground. The mystery-play in its
complete form was inferribly developed and played in a Gentile city;
and its transcription probably coincided with its cessation as a drama.
But the Sacrament was long a quasi-secret rite.</p>
<p class="par">10. The picture drawn in the Acts, in which Peter and
Paul alike &ldquo;turn to the Gentiles&rdquo;&mdash;Peter taking the
initiative&mdash;is the work of a late and discreet redactor, bent on
reconciling Jewish and Gentile factors. It is a highly factitious
account of early Christism; but it preserves traces of the early state
of things, in which no Jesuine teaching was pretended to be current,
and the cult is seen to exist in a scattered form independently of the
central propaganda. It evidently had a footing in Samaria. The
synoptics themselves reveal the absence of baptism from the early
procedure of the cult. Only in the latest of the four canonical gospels
is it pretended that either Jesus or his disciples had baptized.</p>
<p class="par">11. The fourth gospel is only one more systematic step
in the process of myth-making. The biographical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span>school, in giving this up as unhistorical, in
effect admits that the &ldquo;personality&rdquo; of the alleged Teacher
had been so ineffectual as to admit of a successful interposition of a
new and thoroughly mythical figure, entirely supernatural in theory,
but more &ldquo;impressive&rdquo; as a speaking and quasi-human
personage. The &ldquo;Logos&rdquo; of John is again an adaptation of a
Jewish adaptation of a pagan conception, the doctrine of the Logos set
forth by the Alexandrian Jew Philo having come through Greek and
Eastern channels.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6344src" href="#xd23e6344"
name="xd23e6344src">32</a> There was no critical faculty in the early
Church that could secure its rejection, though it was somewhat slow of
acceptance. The doctrine of the Trinity is again an assimilation from
paganism, proximately Egyptian.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6355src"
href="#xd23e6355" name="xd23e6355src">33</a></p>
<p class="par">Such, in outline, is our working hypothesis. As
explained at the outset, it is not supposed that so complex a problem
can in so brief a space and time be conclusively solved; and criticism
will doubtless involve modification when criticism is scientifically
applied. To such scientific criticism the production of a complete
outline may be an aid; previous debate, even when rational in temper,
having been spent on some of the &ldquo;trees&rdquo; without regard to
the &ldquo;wood&rdquo; in general. All that is claimed for the complete
hypothesis is that it is at all points inductively reached, and that
for that reason it squares better with the whole facts than any form of
the biographical theory&mdash;including the highly attenuated
&ldquo;eschatological&rdquo; form in which Jesus is conceived solely as
a proclaimer of &ldquo;the last things.&rdquo; That thesis, indeed,
reduces the biographical theory to complete nullity by leaving the mass
of the record without any explanation save the mythical one, which
suffices equally to account for eschatology. <span class=

Healing</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">It is significant that the later myth-making of
the synoptics is partly by way of reversion to the folk-lore in which
the myth had risen, partly by way of meeting non-Jewish Messianic
requirements, partly by way of Gentilism, partly by way of concessions
to the Gnosticism or occultism whose pretensions in the second century
exercised so strong a pressure on the Church. As Professor Smith points
out, the story in Mark (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2014:51-52">xiv,
51&ndash;52</a>) of the youth who at the betrayal fled naked, leaving
his linen cloth in the hands of the captors,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6385src" href="#xd23e6385" name="xd23e6385src">1</a> is a crude
provision for the Docetic theory that the real Christ did not suffer.
Cerinthus taught that &ldquo;at last Christ departed from Jesus, and
that then Jesus suffered and rose again, while Christ remained
impassible, inasmuch as he was a spiritual being.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6391src" href="#xd23e6391" name=
"xd23e6391src">2</a></p>
<p class="par">In this connection there arises for us the problem,
stressed by Professor Smith, as to the significance of the stories of
wholesale healing and casting out of devils. His thesis is that they
were an occult way of conveying the claim that Jesus by preaching
monotheism had cast out in Galilee the diseases and corruptions of
polytheism, pagan deities being &ldquo;devils&rdquo; for the Jew. And
in view of the repeated assertion, on Gnostic lines, that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>Jesus declared his teaching to be made purposely
occult, so as <i>not</i> to be understood by the people, we cannot deny
the possibility that some of the stories of healing may have been so
intended. Professor Smith, as I understand him, argues<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6404src" href="#xd23e6404" name="xd23e6404src">3</a>
that a straightforward claim of wholesale overthrowing of paganism
would have offended the Roman Government; and that the claim was put by
metaphor to avoid that. The difficulty arises that if the metaphor was
not understood by Gentiles it missed its mark with them; while if they
did understand it their susceptibilities would be particularly wounded
by the metaphors of leprosy and blindness and &ldquo;devils.&rdquo; And
there is the further difficulty that, as Professor Smith notes, the
stories of casting out devils relate solely to half-heathen Galilee,
while, as he also notes, there is no ultimate trace of Jesuism
there.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6409src" href="#xd23e6409" name=
"xd23e6409src">4</a> Why then should an allegory of casting out
polytheism have been framed concerning Galilee?</p>
<p class="par">On any view, it can hardly be doubted that the stories
of healing made their popular appeal as simple miracles. Professor
Schmiedel&rsquo;s argument that the claim of Jesus (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2011:5">Mt. xi, 5</a>;
<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%207:22">Lk. vii,
22</a>) to heal blindness and lameness and leprosy, and to raise the
dead, must be understood in a spiritual sense, seems to me a complete
failure. He contends that if it be taken literally the final claim that
&ldquo;the poor have the gospel preached to them&rdquo; is an
anti-climax. But if we take the miracle-claims to be merely spiritual,
the anti-climax is absolute; for the proposition then runs that the
blind, the lame, the leprous, and the spiritually dead have the gospel
preached to them, and the poor have the gospel preached to them
<i>also</i>. On the other hand, there is no real anti-climax on a
literal interpretation. Plainly, the provision <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>of
good tidings for the merely poor, the most numerous suffering class of
all, was the one thing that <i>could</i> be said to be done for them.
It could not be pretended that they had been made wealthy. Thus a
&ldquo;pillar-text&rdquo; falls, and we are left committed to the
literal interpretation as against both Professor Smith and Professor
Schmiedel. Both, however, will probably agree that most readers always
took the literal view.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6431src" href=

was made by the stories of the Annunciation, the Virgin Birth, the
Adoration by the Magi and the Shepherds, the stable, the
manger,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6446src" href="#xd23e6446" name=
"xd23e6446src">6</a> the menace of Herod, the massacre, and the
flight.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6474src" href="#xd23e6474" name=
"xd23e6474src">7</a> The question that here arises for the mythologist
is whether the birth-myths had belonged to the <i>early</i> Jesus-myth
at a stage before gospel-making commenced, and had at first been
ignored, only to be embodied later. For suggesting that they had been
connected with the early myth I have been told by Dr. Carpenter and Dr.
Conybeare that I ignored the late acceptance of the Christmas Birthday
by &ldquo;the Church,&rdquo; after I had expressly noted the late date
of that acceptance. These critics, as usual, miss the whole
problem.</p>
<p class="par">Either the birth-stories were old lore in Syria (or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>elsewhere in the East)<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6487src" href="#xd23e6487" name="xd23e6487src">8</a> or they were
not. If not, their imposition on the gospel story in the second century
represents an assimilation of quite alien pagan matter, with the assent
of the main body of Jewish Nazar&aelig;ans, who accepted the opening
chapters of the canonical Matthew. Of such an assent, no explanation
can be given from the standpoint or standpoints of Dr. Conybeare and
Dr. Carpenter. It would be a gratuitous capitulation to Gentilism in a
Jewish atmosphere, and this without any sign on the Pauline side of a
Gentile obtrusion of such matter.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6496src"
href="#xd23e6496" name="xd23e6496src">9</a> But if, on the other hand,
we put the hypothesis that such matter had been connected in Syrian
folk-lore with the old Jesus-myth, we at once find an explanation for
the additions to the gospel-story and a new elucidation of the
myth-theory. The spread of the Jesus cult would bring to the front the
primitive myths connected with it which the reigning Judaic sentiment
had at first kept out of sight as savouring of heathenism; and all
Jesus-lore would have a progressive interest for converts. Judaism, in
its redacted sacred books, admitted of quasi-supernatural births in
such cases as those of Sarah and Hannah; but an absolute virgin birth,
a commonplace in heathen mythology,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6499src"
href="#xd23e6499" name="xd23e6499src">10</a> had there no recognition.
Yet the idea <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>was as likely to survive in folk-lore in Syria
as anywhere else; and as Judaism became more and more a hostile thing,
Judaic views would tend in various ways to be set aside.</p>
<p class="par">The hypothesis put by me is (1) that the certainly
unhistorical Miriam of the Pentateuch is inferribly, like Moses and
Joshua, an ancient deity; and that in old Palestinian myth she was the
mother of Joshua. In the Pentateuch she is degraded, as part of the
Evemeristic process of reducing the ancient popular Gods to human
status. That process, which affects Goddesses as <span class="corr" id=
"xd23e6515" title="Source: wel">well</span> as Gods in several ancient
religions,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6518src" href="#xd23e6518" name=
"xd23e6518src">11</a> was for the Hebrew priesthood a necessary rule.
Polytheism was everywhere, in antiquity, and for the Yahwists it must
be cast out. A late Persian tradition that Joshua was the son of
Miriam<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6526src" href="#xd23e6526" name=
"xd23e6526src">12</a> accents the query whether there were no family
relationships in the old Palestinian myths. That the birth in a stable,
with a ritual of babe-worship at the winter or summer solstice, is very
ancient both in the East and in the West, is the conclusion forced on
the mythologist by a mass of evidence; and the location of the stable
at Bethlehem in a cave connects the Christian myth yet further with a
number of those of paganism.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6534src" href=
"#xd23e6534" name="xd23e6534src">13</a> If the matter of the myth was
ancient for Syria, why should not the names of the mother and the child
be so?</p>
<p class="par">The fashion in which the hypothesis is met by the more
impassioned adherents of the biographical view is instructive. Dr.
Conybeare, who thinks it inconceivable that &ldquo;a myth&rdquo; should
be mistaken for &ldquo;a man&rdquo;&mdash;though that mistake is the
gist of masses of mythology&mdash;finds no difficulty in conceiving
that a real woman may be turned into a myth within a century. For him,
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>gospel &ldquo;Mary&rdquo; (Maria or Mariam) must
be a real Jewess because in Mark (<a class="biblink xd23e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%206:3">vi, 3</a>) the
people of Nazareth ask: &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter, the son of
Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are
not his sisters with us?&rdquo; Any thoughtful reader, comparing such a
suddenly projected passage with the opening chapters, realizes that it
is on a wholly different plane of ideas; that no one
&ldquo;author&rdquo; can have posited both; and that the later is part
of a process of localization and debate, in connection with the thesis
that the healer could &ldquo;do no wonder-work&rdquo; at home because
of the unbelief of his own people. Furthermore, in <a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%2015:40">Mark xv,
40</a>, we have the group of women which includes &ldquo;Mary the
mother of James the Little and of Joses,&rdquo; concerning whom we are
told that when Jesus was in Galilee they &ldquo;followed him, and
ministered unto him.&rdquo; How many Maries, then, were mothers of
James and Joses? Evidently the Mary of the latter passage is <i>not</i>
regarded by its writer as the mother of Jesus. Then the prior passage
is the later in order of time, and alien to the other legends.</p>
<p class="par">Our exegete, nevertheless, is not only at once
dogmatically certain that he has found a real Jesus, son of Mary, but
proceeds to assert, in three separate passages, that in Mark&rsquo;s
gospel Jesus is known as &ldquo;the son of Joseph and Mary,&rdquo;
though Joseph is never mentioned in that gospel. It is of a piece with
his instantaneous invention of a &ldquo;genuine tradition&rdquo; out of
a modern hint, perverted. And it is this operator who, meeting with a
list of analogies (so described) which suggest that
&ldquo;Miriam&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mariam&rdquo; are variants of a
Mother-Goddess name generally current through the East, becomes
incoherent in explosive protest, and begins by informing me that the
&ldquo;original form of the name is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>not Maria but Miriam,
which does not lend itself to [these] hardy equations.&rdquo; As Miriam
had been expressly named and discussed by me in the very first
instance, the intimation tells only of the mental disconnection which
is the general mark of this writer&rsquo;s procedure.</p>
<p class="par">The question, of course, is not philological at all; and
not only was no philological &ldquo;equation&rdquo; ever hinted at, but
the very passage attacked begins with the avowal that it is impossible
to prove historical connections, and that what is in question is
<i>analogy</i> of &ldquo;name and epithets.&rdquo; Nothing in philology
is more speculative than the explanation of early names. Any one who
has noted the discussion over &ldquo;Moses,&rdquo; and noted the
diverging theories, from the Coptic &ldquo;water-rescued&rdquo; or
&ldquo;water-child&rdquo; (<i>mo-use</i>) of Josephus and Philo and
Jablonski and Deutsch to the Egyptian &ldquo;child&rdquo; (<i>mes</i>
or <i>mesu</i>) of Lepsius and Dillmann, and the inference of an
&ldquo;abbreviation of a theophorous Egyptian name&rdquo; drawn by
Renan and Guthe, will see that there is small light to be had from
&ldquo;equations.&rdquo; When &ldquo;Miriam&rdquo; is expertly
described as &ldquo;a distortion either of Merari [misri] or of
Amramith,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6575src" href="#xd23e6575"
name="xd23e6575src">14</a> the mythologist is moved to seek for other
clues. The philology of Maria and Mariam is a hopeless problem.</p>
<p class="par">Now, if the Moses legend is to be held Egyptian, the
Miriam legend may well be so too; and in the items that the Egyptian
princess who saves the child Moses is in a Jewish legend named Merris,
and that one of the daughters of Ramses II is found to be named
Meri,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6585src" href="#xd23e6585" name=
"xd23e6585src">15</a> the <i>analogy</i> is worth noting. But the
central mythological fact is that a Mother-Goddess, a
&ldquo;Madonna&rdquo; nursing a child, is one of the commonest objects
of ancient worship throughout Asia and North Africa.<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e6593src" href="#xd23e6593" name="xd23e6593src">16</a> When,
then, mothers of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214"
name="pb214">214</a>]</span>Gods born in caves, or Dying Demigods, are
found bearing such names as Myrrha and Maia; when Maia is noted to have
the meaning &ldquo;nurse,&rdquo; and Mylitta that of &ldquo;the
child-bearing one,&rdquo; we are not only moved to surmise a
Mother-Goddess-name of many variants, of which Miriam-Mariam is one,
but to infer a wide diffusion of legends concerning such a
goddess-type. Figures of such a goddess abounded throughout the
East.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6602src" href="#xd23e6602" name=
"xd23e6602src">17</a> That is, in brief, the mythological case at this
point. Mary in the gospels, the virgin bearing a divine child, flying
from danger, and bearing her child on a journey, in a cave, is the
analogue of a dozen ancient myths of the Divine Child; the Menaced
Child is common to the myths of Moses and Sargon, Krishna and Cyrus,
Arthur and Herakles; the stable-ritual of the Adoration is prehistoric
in India in connection with Krishna; the &ldquo;manger&rdquo; (a
basket) belongs equally to the myths of Zeus, Hermes, Ion and Dionysos;
and the threatening king is a myth-figure found alike in East and
West.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6611src" href="#xd23e6611" name=
"xd23e6611src">18</a></p>
<p class="par">All this <i>is</i> ostensibly &ldquo;sun-myth.&rdquo;
And we are asked by Dr. Conybeare to believe, on the strength of one
late and palpable interpolation in Mark, which has no other word
concerning the childhood, parentage, or birthplace of Jesus, its Son of
God, that his mother Mary was a well-known figure in Nazareth about the
year 30, and that it is merely she who is made to play the mythic part
in Matthew about a century later. The simple use of common-sense, even
by a reader who has not studied comparative mythology, will reveal the
improbability of such a development; and Dr. Conybeare, who vehemently
denies, for other purposes, that the early Christians <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>in
Palestine could have <i>any</i> knowledge of pagan myths, is the last
person who could consistently affirm it. But when we realize that under
the shell of official Judaism there subsisted in Palestine as
everywhere else the folk-lore of the past;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6626src" href="#xd23e6626" name="xd23e6626src">19</a> when we
remember the &ldquo;weeping for Tammuz&rdquo; at Jerusalem and the
location of the birth of Adonis in the very stable-cave of the
Christ-legend at Bethlehem, we can quite rationally conceive how, once
the Jesus-myth was well re-established, old pre-Judaic elements of it
came to the front, and found from the later gospel-compilers a welcome
they could not have had in the Judaizing days.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6638src" href="#xd23e6638" name="xd23e6638src">20</a></p>
<p class="par">The Joseph myth, again, is a very obvious construction.
In Mark, which Dr. Conybeare repeatedly and shrilly declares to be the
primary authority, Joseph is never once mentioned, though Dr.
Conybeare, with the eye of imagination, finds that he is. In Matthew,
he figures throughout the birth-story of the opening section,
admittedly a late addition. In Luke, still later, he is still further
developed, Mark&rsquo;s &ldquo;son of Mary&rdquo; becoming (<a class=
"biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%204:22">iv, 22</a>)
&ldquo;the son of Joseph,&rdquo; in a palpably late fiction. Any
critical method worthy of the name would reckon with such plain marks
of late fabrication. Joseph has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216"
href="#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>been super-imposed on the
myth for a reason; and the reason is that a Messiah &ldquo;the Son of
Joseph&rdquo; was demanded from the Samaritan side as a Messiah the Son
of David was demanded (albeit not universally) from the Judaic
side.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6648src" href="#xd23e6648" name=
"xd23e6648src">21</a> By naming Jesus&rsquo; earthly putative father
Joseph, in the Davidic descent, both requirements were met, on lines of
traditionalist psychology.</p>
<p class="par">When this solution is met by the Unitarian thesis that
the idea of a Messiah Ben Joseph is late in Judaism, and that it arose
out of the gospel story, we can but appeal to the common-sense of the
reader.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6655src" href="#xd23e6655" name=
"xd23e6655src">22</a> For the Rabbis to set up such a formula on such a
motive would be an inconceivable self-stultification. The lateness of
Rabbinical discussion on the subject can be quite reasonably explained
through its Samaritan origination. All the while, the Joseph story in
the gospels belongs precisely to that late legend which the
neo-Unitarian school is bound in consistency to reject as myth. But the
prepossession in favour of a &ldquo;human Jesus&rdquo; balks at no
inconsistency, and selects its items not on critical principles but
simply in so far as they can be made to compose with a
&ldquo;human&rdquo; figure that is to be conserved at all costs.</p>
<p class="par">The curious myth-motive of the
&ldquo;taxing&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6667src" href=

Krishna-myth,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6673src" href="#xd23e6673"

thesis that that myth in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href=

Christian story. The general thesis breaks down completely;<a class=

"xd23e6680src">25</a> and in this one instance we are obviously

intermediate Asiatic source connecting with the Indian.<a class=

<p class="par first">To discuss in similar detail the myths of the
Apocryphal gospels and the still later myths of Catholic Christendom
would only be to extend the area of our demonstration without adding to
its scientific weight. The general result would only be to prove
derivations from pagan sources and to exhibit more fully the process
(<i>a</i>) of inventing sayings of Jesus to vindicate different views
of his Messianic and other functions, and (<i>b</i>) of enforcing
ethical views by his authority. The legend of St. Christopher, for
instance, is but a variant, probably iconographic in motive, of a
multiform pagan myth which probably roots in a ritual of
child-carrying.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6712src" href="#xd23e6712"
name="xd23e6712src">27</a> Iconography yields many evidences. The
conventional <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>figure of the Good-Shepherd carrying a sheep,
which like the Birth-Story has counted for so much in popularizing
Christianity, is admittedly derived from pagan art,<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e6721src" href="#xd23e6721" name="xd23e6721src">28</a> like the
conventional angel-figure. Even the figure of Peter<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e6727src" href="#xd23e6727" name="xd23e6727src">29</a> as the
bearer of the keys, head of the Twelve, and denier of his Lord,
connects curiously with the myths of Proteus and Janus
Bifrons,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6738src" href="#xd23e6738" name=
"xd23e6738src">30</a> both bearers of the cosmic keys.</p>
<p class="par">Iconography, again, is probably the source, for the
gospels, of the myth of the Temptation, which professional scholars
continue solemnly to discuss as a &ldquo;biographical&rdquo; episode to
be somehow reduced to historicity. The story coincides so absolutely
with the Gr&aelig;co-Roman account, evidently derived from painting or
sculpture, of Pan (in figure the Satan of the Jews) standing by the
young Jupiter on a mountain-top before an altar,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6762src" href="#xd23e6762" name="xd23e6762src">31</a> that it
might seem unnecessary to go further. But, recognizing that &ldquo;of
myth there is no &lsquo;original,&rsquo; save man&rsquo;s immemorial
dream,&rdquo; and remembering that there are similar Temptation myths
concerning Buddha and Zarathustra, we are bound to extend the inquiry.
The results are very interesting.</p>
<p class="par">We are specially concerned with the versions of Matthew
and Luke, of which Dr. Spitta, by analysis, finds the Lucan the
earlier,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6771src" href="#xd23e6771" name=
"xd23e6771src">32</a> pronouncing the Marcan to be a curtailment and
manipulation, not the primary <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219"
href="#pb219" name="pb219">219</a>]</span>source, as was maintained by
Von Harnack and many others.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6783src" href=
"#xd23e6783" name="xd23e6783src">33</a> The essence of the story, as
episode, is the presence of the God and the Adversary on a high place,
surveying &ldquo;the kingdoms of the world.&rdquo; This originates
proximately in Babylonian astronomy and astrology, where the Goat-God
is represented standing beside the Sun-God on &ldquo;the mountain of
the world,&rdquo; that is, the height of the heavens, at the beginning
of the sun&rsquo;s yearly course in the sign Capricorn, which,
personified, figures as the sun&rsquo;s tutor and guide. Graphically
represented, it is the origin of a series of Greek myths&mdash;Pan and
Zeus; Marsyas and Apollo; Silenus and Dionysos&mdash;all turning on a
goat-legged figure beside a young God on a mountain-top. Satan and
Jesus are but another variant, probably deriving from Greek
iconography, but possibly more directly from the East, where the idea
of a Temptation goes back to the Vedas.</p>
<p class="par">The theologians, reluctantly admitting, of late, that
the Devil could not carry Jesus through the air, anxiously debate as to
whether or not Jesus had strange psychic experiences which he
communicated to his disciples; and, utterly ignoring comparative
mythology, look for motivation, as usual, only in the Old Testament.
Spitta, after checking these researches, and declaring that the man is
not to be envied who hopes to explain the story by Old Testament
parallels from the forty years of wandering in the wilderness,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6788src" href="#xd23e6788" name=
"xd23e6788src">34</a> confidently concludes that it stands for the
spiritual experience of Jesus in regard to his Messianic
ideal.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6791src" href="#xd23e6791" name=
"xd23e6791src">35</a> To such a biographical inference he has not the
slightest critical right on his own principles. The gospels say nothing
whatever of any communication <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220"
href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>on the subject by Jesus to
his disciples. The story is myth pure and simple, and belongs to
universal mythology.</p>
<p class="par">Mark turned the story to the illustration of the
doctrine laid down in the <span class="sc">Testaments of the Twelve
Patriarchs</span>,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6803src" href=
"#xd23e6803" name="xd23e6803src">36</a> that devils and wild beasts
will flee from the righteous man; and Luke and Matthew turn it into an
affirmation of the theological maxims of Jewish monotheism; but these
are simply the invariable practices of the evangelists, steeped in the
habits of thought of Jewish symbolism. The myth remains; and the story,
as story, has counted for a great deal more in Christian popular lore
than the theology. When the writer of the fourth gospel put the miracle
of turning water into wine in the forefront of his work, he doubtless
had symbolic intentions;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6806src" href=
"#xd23e6806" name="xd23e6806src">37</a> but his story is simply an
adaptation of the annual Dionysiac rite of turning water into wine at
the festival of the God on Twelfth Night.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6809src" href="#xd23e6809" name="xd23e6809src">38</a> It may have
come either from the Greek or from the eastern side. The duplicated
tale of the Feeding of the Five Thousand, again, is either an
adaptation of or an attempt to excel the story of the feeding of the
host of Dionysos in a waterless desert in his campaign against the
Titans.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6816src" href="#xd23e6816" name=
"xd23e6816src">39</a> As the God had the power of miraculously
producing, by touch, corn and wine and oil, his lore doubtless included
miracles of feeding. The touch of the seating of the people &ldquo;in

<p class="par">Thus did paganism, chased out of the window of early
Judaic Christianity, re-enter by all the doors, supplying the growing
Church with the forms of psychic and literary attraction which
ultimately served to give it a general hold over the ignorant and
uncivilized masses of decadent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221"

dissolving in universal schism when Constantine saved it&mdash;or at
least its body&mdash;by establishing it. As the Church broadened its
basis, especially after its establishment, its assimilation of pagan
ideas, names and practices, became so general that the process has long
been made a standing ground of Protestant impeachment of the Church of
Rome.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6853src" href="#xd23e6853" name=

<p class="par">Of that process the myth-theory is simply the attempted
scientific consummation. It is resisted as every previous step was
resisted, before and after Middleton, partly in sincere religious
conviction, partly on the simple instinctive resentment felt for every
&ldquo;upsetting&rdquo; theory about matters which men have habitually
taken for granted. Some of the best reasoned resistance comes from
professional theologians who have been disciplined by the habit of
exact argument in the documentary field; some of the worst, as we have
seen, comes from professed rationalists or Neo-Unitarians, who bring to
the problem first and last the temper of spleen and bluster which
history associates with the typical priest. Bluster never settles
anything: argument, given free play under conditions which foster the
intellectual life, in the end settles everything, even for the
emotionalists who worship their instincts. But as historical like
physical science is a process of continuous expansion and
reconsideration, there can in this contest be no &ldquo;triumph&rdquo;
for anything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>but the principle of unending renewal of
thought, which is but an aspect of the principle of life. Insofar as
the solution now offered is inadequate, it will in due course be
improved upon; insofar as it is false, it will be ousted.</p>
<p class="par">The average cleric, of course, does not attempt
confutation. Realizing that it is prudent to avoid debate on such
matters, he relies on the proved proclivity of &ldquo;human
nature&rdquo; to beliefs which fall-in with habit, normal emotion, and
normal religiosity; and his faith is, practically speaking, not
ill-grounded. A thesis which looks first and last to scientific truth
is therefore not addressed to him. It is addressed to the more earnest
of the laity and the clerisy&mdash;hardly to those indeed who hold, as
an amiable curate once put it to me, that &ldquo;in the providence of
God&rdquo; all heresy is short-lived; but to those who, caring for
righteousness, do not on that score cast out the spirit of truth. Many
such are honestly convinced that the teaching on which they have been
taught to found their conceptions of goodness cannot be the accretion
of a myth; and many who acknowledge an abundance of myth in the
documents are still insistent on elements of &ldquo;religious&rdquo;
truth which they find even in systematic forgeries. The countenance
thus given by the more liberal and critical theologians to the more
uncritical stands constantly in the way even of the acceptance of the
comparatively rational views of the former.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6882src" href="#xd23e6882" name="xd23e6882src">43</a> There is
reason then to ask whether the notion that human conduct is in any way
dependent on visionary beliefs is any sounder than those beliefs
themselves. On this head, something falls to be said in conclusion.

theory the Proto-Christian Joshua-God was a composite myth &ldquo;made
up of <i>memories</i> of Krishna ... and a hundred other fiends,&rdquo;
is of the same order. In his case, of course, I do not charge omission
to read the statement he falsifies: it is simply a matter of his normal
inability to understand any position he attacks. As regards the
Krishna-myth I suggest only in the detail of the &ldquo;taxing&rdquo;
the possibility of Christian borrowing through an intermediate source:
in another, that of &ldquo;the bag&rdquo; which is carried by a hostile
demon-follower of Krishna (<i>C.M.</i> 241&ndash;3), I suggest the
possibility of Indian borrowing from the fourth gospel, where
&ldquo;the bag&rdquo; is presumptively derived from a stage accessory
in the mystery-drama, Judas carrying a bag to receive his

<p class="par first">Not only to the myth-theory but to every attempt
at ejecting historical falsity from religion there has been offered the
objection that religion &ldquo;does good&rdquo;; that mankind needs
&ldquo;some religion or other&rdquo;; and that to &ldquo;undermine
faith&rdquo; does social harm, even if it be by way of driving out
delusion. This position is not at all special to orthodoxy. It was
taken up by Middleton; by Kant, when he shaped a
&ldquo;practical&rdquo; basis for theistic belief after eliminating the
theoretic, and counselled unbelieving clergymen to use the Bible for
purposes of popular moral education; by Voltaire when he combated
atheism after bombarding Christianity; and by Paine when he wrote his
<span class="sc">Age of Reason</span> to save the belief in God.</p>
<p class="par">Insofar as the general plea merely amounts to saying
that mankind cannot conceivably give up its traditional religion at a
stroke; that liberal-minded priests are better than illiberal, for all
purposes; and that in a world dominated by economic need it is
impossible for many enlightened clergymen to secure a living save in
the profession for which they were trained, I am not at all concerned
to combat it. For the liberal priest, enlightened too late to reshape
his economic career, I have nothing but sympathy, provided that he in
no way hampers the intellectual progress of others. Insofar, again, as
the plea for &ldquo;religion&rdquo; is merely a plea for a word, or a
thesis that all earnest conviction about life is religion, it is quite
irrelevant to the present discussion. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb224" href="#pb224" name="pb224">224</a>]</span>The rationalists who
feel they cannot face the world without the label of
&ldquo;religion&rdquo; for their theory of the cosmos and of conduct
will be in the same position whether they believe in a
&ldquo;historical Jesus&rdquo; or not; and those who must have a
humanist &ldquo;liturgy&rdquo; of some sort in place of the
ecclesiastical are apparently not troubled by problems of historicity.
What we are concerned with is the notion that to deny the historicity
of Jesus is somehow to imperil not only ethics but historical
science.</p>
<p class="par">M. Loisy puts the last point in his suggestion, in
criticism of Drews, that he who thinks to break down either all the
traditional or the &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; orthodoxies by denying the
historic actuality of Jesus will find he has &ldquo;only furnished to
their defenders the occasion to persuade a certain not uncultivated
public that the divinity of Christ, or at least the unique character of
his personality, is as well guaranteed as the reality of his life and
his death.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6909src" href="#xd23e6909"
name="xd23e6909src">1</a> Had M. Loisy then forgotten that his own

<p class="par">But we must not turn the jest to earnest. There are
plenty of honest laymen to play the jury; and to them let it be put.
The issue between us and M. Loisy, as he virtually admits, must be
fought out by argument. It is perfectly true, as he says, that
&ldquo;in principle, nothing is more legitimate, more necessary, than
the comparative method; but nothing is more delicate to
handle.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6928src" href="#xd23e6928"
name="xd23e6928src">4</a> Every issue, then, must be vigilantly
debated. But the obligation is reciprocal. In these inquiries we have
found M. Loisy many times in untenable positions, and resorting to
inconsistent arguments. The tests which he applies to a mass of
tradition are equally destructive to most of what he retains.</p>
<p class="par">Let illicit employments of the comparative method be
discredited by all means; but let us also have done with a criticism
which on one leaf claims that Jesus gave a &ldquo;homogeneous&rdquo;
teaching which his disciples could not have &ldquo;combined,&rdquo; and
on the next avows that &ldquo;the gospel ethic is no more consistent
than the hope of the kingdom.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e6935src" href="#xd23e6935" name="xd23e6935src">5</a> And when the
myth-theorists are called upon to make no unwarranted assumptions, let
us also have an end of such assertions as that &ldquo;twenty-five or
thirty years after the death of Jesus the principal sentences and
parables of which the apostolic generation had kept memory were put in
writing.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6940src" href="#xd23e6940"
name="xd23e6940src">6</a> This is pure hypothesis, unsupported by
evidence.</p>
<p class="par">The issue between us and M. Loisy, once more, is not one
in which merely he assails the myth-theory as outgoing its proofs: it
is one in which <i>his</i> positions are at the same time assailed all
along the line, and particularly at its centre, as incapable of
resisting critical pressure. By all means let us seek that &ldquo;the
science of religion should be applied without preoccupations of
contemporary propaganda or polemic.&rdquo; The present writer
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name=
"pb226">226</a>]</span>reached the myth-theory not by way of propaganda
but as a result of sheer protracted failure to establish a presupposed
historical foundation. Professor Smith disclaims all criticism of
&ldquo;Christianity.&rdquo; And if Professor Drews be blamed for
avowing a religious aim, the answer is that he would otherwise be
assailed as &ldquo;irreligious,&rdquo; alike in his own country and
elsewhere. The myth-theory has to meet other foes than M. Loisy.</p>
<p class="par">It is remarkable that Professor Schmiedel, who has gone
nearly as far as M. Loisy in recognizing in detail the force of the
pressures on the historical position, makes the avowal: &ldquo;My
inmost religious convictions would suffer no harm, even if I now felt
obliged to conclude that <i>Jesus never lived</i>,&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e6957src" href="#xd23e6957" name="xd23e6957src">7</a>
though as a critical historian he &ldquo;sees no prospect of
this.&rdquo; He further avows that his religion does not require him
&ldquo;to find in Jesus an absolutely perfect model,&rdquo; and that in
effect he does not find him so.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6962src"
href="#xd23e6962" name="xd23e6962src">8</a> And he wrote in 1906 that
&ldquo;for about six years the view that Jesus never really lived has
gained an ever-growing number of supporters,&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e6967src" href="#xd23e6967" name="xd23e6967src">9</a> adding
that &ldquo;it is no use to ignore it, or to frame resolutions against
it.&rdquo; It is accordingly with no kind of polemic motive as against
so entirely candid a writer that I suggest certain criticisms of his
emotional positions as tending unconsciously to affect his judgment of
the critical problem.</p>
<p class="par">It is after the avowals above cited that he
writes:&mdash;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e6974src" href="#xd23e6974"

<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">Nor do I ask whether in Jesus&rsquo; faith and
ethical system what he had to offer was new. <i>Was it able to give me
something that would warm my heart and strengthen my
life?</i>&mdash;that is all I ask. What does it matter if one of the
ideas of Jesus had been expressed once already in India, another once
already in Greece, a third once already, or many times, by the Old
Testament prophets, or by the much-praised Jewish Rabbis shortly before
the time of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>Jesus? Such ideas may be found in books: that is
all. What we ought to feel grateful to Jesus for, is that he was
<i>destined for the first time to make the ideas take effect and
influence the lives of mankind in general</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It would, I think, be difficult to over-estimate the
amount of psychic bias involved in that pronouncement, which contains a
theorem no more fitly to be taken for granted than any concrete
historic proposition. The Professor, it will be observed, does not
specify a single teaching of Jesus as new, while admitting that
<i>some</i> were not. What he says is, in effect, that other utterances
of Jesuine doctrines do not &ldquo;warm the heart&rdquo;; that those of
Jesus do; and that they &ldquo;for the first time&rdquo; caused certain
doctrines to &ldquo;take effect and influence the lives of mankind in
general.&rdquo; <i>What</i> doctrines then are meant, and what effects
are posited? And <i>why</i> do other utterances of the doctrines not
&ldquo;warm the heart&rdquo;?</p>
<p class="par">Presumably the doctrines in question are those of mutual
love, of forgiveness of enemies, of doing as we would be done by.
Concerning the gospel doctrine of reward the Professor makes a
disclaimer; and concerning the doctrine that God cares for men as for
the lilies and the birds he pronounces that it is &ldquo;to-day not
merely untrue: it is not even religious in the deepest sense of the
term.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7005src" href="#xd23e7005"
name="xd23e7005src">11</a> It is not then clear that he would acclaim
the doctrine that to help the distressed is to succour the Lord. In any
case, the detailed religious prescription of beneficence was not merely
a Jewish maxim: it was an article of Egyptian religion;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e7010src" href="#xd23e7010" name=
"xd23e7010src">12</a> and it can hardly be in respect of such teaching
that the Professor affirms a new &ldquo;influence on the lives of
mankind in general.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Is it then in respect of mutual love and the forgiveness
of enemies? If so, when did the change begin? Among the apostles? Among
the Fathers? Among the bishops? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228"
href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>Among the Popes? To put the
issue broadly, was there more of good human life in Byzantium than in
pagan Greece; or even in the Rome of the Decadence and the Dark and
Middle Ages than in the Rome of the Republic? Was it because of
Christian goodness that the decline of Rome was accelerated instead of
being checked? And, to come to our own day, is the World War an
evidence for an ethical change wrought by the teaching of Jesus&mdash;a
war forced on the world by a Germany where there are more systematic
students of the gospels than in all the rest of Europe? I leave it to
Professor Schmiedel and Professor Drews to settle the point between
them. They would perhaps agree&mdash;though as to this I am
uncertain&mdash;on the Jesuine doctrine that morality is &ldquo;nothing
more than obedience to the will of God&rdquo;; and that &ldquo;every
deed is to be judged by the standard, Will it bear the gaze of
God?&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7019src" href="#xd23e7019" name=
"xd23e7019src">13</a> In any case I will affirm, for the consideration
of those who on any such ground cling to the notion of something unique
in the teaching of Jesus, that humanity is likely to make a much better
world when it substitutes for such a moral standard, which is but a
self-deluding substitution of God for the conscience that delimits God,
the principle of goodwill towards men, and the law of reciprocity,
articulately known to the mass of mankind millenniums before the
Christian era, and all along disobeyed, then as now, partly because
religious codes intervene between it and life.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7024src" href="#xd23e7024" name="xd23e7024src">14</a></p>
<p class="par">If it be admitted&mdash;and who will considerately deny
it?&mdash;that the moral progress of mankind is made in virtue of
recognition of the law of reciprocity, the case for the general moral
influence of Christianity is disposed of, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb229" href="#pb229" name="pb229">229</a>]</span>once for all. If the
affirmation be still made, let it confront the challenge of rational
sociology,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7031src" href="#xd23e7031" name=
"xd23e7031src">15</a> founded on the survey of all history&mdash;and
the World War. Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s large affirmation is vain in
the face of all that. His real psychic basis, which in my judgment
determines his critical presuppositions, lies in the phrase:
&ldquo;warms my heart.&rdquo; And that phrase is a tacit confession of
religious partisanship, the result of his Christian training.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e7036src" href="#xd23e7036" name=
"xd23e7036src">16</a></p>
<p class="par">The more the moral teaching of the gospels is
comparatively studied, as apart from their myths of action and dogma,
the more clear becomes its <i>entire</i> dependence on previous
lore,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7044src" href="#xd23e7044" name=
"xd23e7044src">17</a> and its failure even to maintain the level of the
best of that. The Sermon on the Mount is <i>wholly</i>
pre-Christian.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7053src" href="#xd23e7053"
name="xd23e7053src">18</a> It is a Christian scholar who points out
that the Christian doctrine of forgiveness is fully set forth in the
<span class="sc">Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs</span>, a century
before the Christian era. In his view, those verses<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e7064src" href="#xd23e7064" name="xd23e7064src">19</a>
&ldquo;contain the most remarkable statement on the subject of
forgiveness in all ancient literature.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=

does it not warm the heart of Professor Schmiedel equally with the
doctrine of the gospels? Simply because he was brought up to assign
pre-eminence to the teaching of Jesus&mdash;God or Man. And here we
have, in its fundamental form, that unchecked assumption of
&ldquo;uniqueness&rdquo; which secretly dictates the bulk of the
denials of the myth-theory. Canon Charles explicitly traces the Jesuine
teaching to the verses in question:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">That our Lord was acquainted with them, and that

is the highest and noblest known to us....</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">One puts with diffidence the challenge, Was it then high
and noble for the Teacher to give out as his own the teaching of
another, instead of acknowledging it? Is it not incomparably more
likely, on every aspect of the case, that the older teaching was thus
appropriated by gospel-makers bent at once on giving the Divine One a
high message and on securing acceptance for it by putting it in his
mouth? Is not this the strict critical verdict, apart from any other
issue?</p>
<p class="par">The bias which balks at such a decision is the sign of
the harm done to intellectual ethic by the inculcated presupposition.
It ought to &ldquo;warm the heart&rdquo; of a good man to realize that
the ideas which he has been taught to think the noblest were not the
&ldquo;unique&rdquo; production of a Superman, but could be and were
reached by Jews and Gentiles&mdash;for they are Gentile
also&mdash;whose very names are unknown to us. A doctrine of
forgiveness arose in prostrate Jewry precisely because rancour had
there reached its maximum. As a doctrine of asceticism rises in a
society where license has been at the extreme, so the phenomena of hate
breed a recoil from that. The doctrine of non-resistance was current
among the Pharisees of the period of the Maccabean revolt; and the
<span class="sc">Testaments of the Patriarchs</span> is the work of a
Pharisee. And the gospels have nevertheless taught all Christians to
regard the Pharisees collectively, with the Scribes, as a body devoid
of all goodness. There is, be it said&mdash;not for the first
time&mdash;a pessimism in the Christian conception of things; a
pessimism which denies the element of goodness in man in the very act
of ascribing it as a specialty to One, and relying on his
&ldquo;influence&rdquo; to spread it among men <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span>incapable of rising to it for themselves. The
story of Lycurgus and Alcander is the best ancient example to the
precept, quite transcending that of the good Samaritan,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e7097src" href="#xd23e7097" name=
"xd23e7097src">22</a> and it is one of the antidotes to the Christian
pessimism which stultifies its own parable by denying in effect that
The Samaritan could <i>think</i> as ethically as The Jew.</p>
<p class="par">It is pessimism, yet again, that accepts the verdict:
&ldquo;Christianity is the truth of humanity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e7108src" href="#xd23e7108" name="xd23e7108src">23</a> Were it
not that Dr. Schmiedel endorses it, I should have been inclined to use
a stronger term. This too is myth-making. It would be strange indeed if
any depth of truth were sounded by men who had not the first elements
of a conscience for truth of statement, truth of history: whose very
notion of truth was a production of fiction. The &ldquo;truth of
humanity&rdquo; is something infinitely wider than the structure raised
by the &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; and &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; of the
Jesus-cult, out of pre-existing materials, some two thousand years ago;
and humanity will outlive that presentment of its cosmos and its
destinies as it has outlived others. If it should carry something of
the one with it, so does it from the others&mdash;even as the one drew
from its predecessors; and it will certainly jettison more than it will
keep. I have not noted in the <span class="sc">Testaments of the
Patriarchs</span> any such nullification of its doctrine of forgiveness
as is embodied in the promise of future perdition for Chorazin and
Bethsaida, or in the story of Ananias and Sapphira, to say nothing of
the Jesuine doctrine of future torment. The hate that breathes in
&ldquo;Ye brood of vipers&rdquo;; in the continual malediction
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>against Scribes and Pharisees as universally
hypocrites, &ldquo;sons of Gehenna,&rdquo; making their proselytes
twice as bad as themselves; and in the Johannine &ldquo;your father the
devil&rdquo;&mdash;all these are &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; specialties,
turning to naught the Jewish precept of forgiveness.</p>
<p class="par">And I can &ldquo;see no prospect&rdquo; of a long
currency for Professor Schmiedel&rsquo;s panegyric of fictitious
sayings in Acts<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7121src" href="#xd23e7121"
name="xd23e7121src">24</a> as &ldquo;of the deepest that can be said
about the inner Christian life.&rdquo; If that be so, what amount of
profundity goes to the whole construction of the faith? How long is it
to be maintained that the secret or inspiration of good life lies in
the ideas of men for whom the framing of false history was a pious
occupation? The main ethical content of the Christian system, the moral
doctrine by which the Church has lived down till the other day, is the
ethic-defying doctrine of the redemption of mankind by a blood
sacrifice&mdash;a survival of immemorial savagery. That is still the
specifically &ldquo;evangelical&rdquo; view of Christianity. After
living by the doctrine through two eras, the slowly civilizing
conscience of the Church has itself begun to repudiate it; and we have
the characteristic spectacle of its defenders declaring that the very
terms of the historic creed form a libel framed by its enemies. Taught
at last by human reason that the doctrine of sacrifice is the negation
of morality, they pretend that that doctrine is not Christian. Without
it, their Church would never have taken its historic form. To eliminate
it, they have to suppress half their literature, prose and verse. The
accommodations by which the fundamental immorality has been modified in
the interests of saner morality are but the dictates of human
experience; and these dictates are in turn pretended to be the
revelation of the faith that flouted them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Unless the world is again to retrogress collectively in
its civilization, this polemic will not long avail to obscure historic
issues. It is not merely the &ldquo;religion&rdquo; of Professor Drews,
it is the emancipated human reason, that denies the mortmain of ancient
Syria over the field of ethical thought, and claims the birthright of
modern man in his own moral law. Not one day has passed since the
penning of the Apocalypse without men&rsquo;s hating each other in the
name of Jesus. Wars generations long have been waged for
interpretations of the lore. Hatred and malice and all uncharitableness
stamp all the Sacred Books; and the literature of the Fathers imports
into the dwindling intellectual life of the West all the rancour of
battling Judaism. In our own day, Professor Schmiedel is malignantly
assailed in the name of the divinity of the figure of which he claims
to prove the exemplary humanity, his reasoned argument winning him no
goodwill from the supernaturalists. And around him there figure
virulent partisans, incapable of his candour, so little capable of love
for enemies that they cannot conduct a debate without passion,
perversion and insolence. A multitude of those who acclaim the gospel
Jesus as the supreme Teacher reveal themselves as below the standards
of normal candour.</p>
<p class="par">From such pretenders to moral authority, the seeker for
truth turns to the layman similarly concerned, and to those
professional scholars who are capable of debating without passion, and
in good faith. Professor Schmiedel and M. Loisy are still, it is to be
hoped, types of many. The problem is in the end, unalterably, one of
historical science; and only by the use of all the methods of sound
historical science will it ever be solved.</p>
<p class="par">It is not merely in regard to the study of Christian
origins that sociological problems are vitiated by the habitual passing
of &agrave; priori judgments on issues never critically considered.
When an expert hierologist like <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234"
href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>Dr. Budge tells us repeatedly
that in ancient Egypt a &ldquo;highly spiritual,&rdquo; &ldquo;lofty
spiritual&rdquo; and &ldquo;elevated&rdquo; religion went hand in hand
with a system of sorcery of &ldquo;degrading&rdquo; savagery,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e7140src" href="#xd23e7140" name=
"xd23e7140src">25</a> we are led to inquire how the estimates of
altitude are reached or justified. There appears to be no answer save
that Dr. Budge holds certain theories about the universe, and, finding
these more or less akin to the esoteric theology of Egypt, laurels his
own opinions in this fashion. But Dr. Budge is no more entitled than
any one else to settle such questions without rational discussion, and
the reason of some of us revolts at the concept of a conjoined
sublimity and imbecility as a spurious paradox. It is but a convention
of supernaturalist apriorism, figuring where it has no right of entry.
In precisely the same fashion, Dr. Estlin Carpenter credits to the
Aztecs a &ldquo;lofty religious sentiment,&rdquo; avowed to be
&ldquo;strangely blended with a hideous and sanguinary
ritual.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7145src" href="#xd23e7145"
name="xd23e7145src">26</a> The &ldquo;lofty&rdquo; is again a wreath
for the writer&rsquo;s own philosophy of religion, in terms of which
the act of the &ldquo;good Samaritan,&rdquo; performed a million times
by unpretending human beings, was <i>imaginable</i> only by a
supernormal Jew, and unmatchable in pagan thought.</p>
<p class="par">In a word, these moral pretensions had better be
withdrawn from the area of historical discussion proper. Involving as
they do the inference that &ldquo;lofty&rdquo; religious conceptions
are not merely of no moral value but potent sanctions for all manner of
evil, they very effectually stultify themselves. But rationalism needs
not, and should not seek, to turn such blunders to its account. As M.
Loisy claims, the ground of historic criticism is not the place for
such polemic, which tends only to confuse the scientific issue. That is
hard enough to solve, with the best will and the best methods.

discovered by Philotheos Bryennios, Metropolitan of Nicomedia (then of
Serres), in 1873, in the library attached to the Monastery of the Most
Holy Sepulchre, in the Phanar, or Greek quarter, of Constantinople. It
was part of a manuscript containing several ancient documents,
including two Epistles of Clement of Rome, which Bryennios published in
1875. Not till 1883 did he publish the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Of the genuineness of the MS. there can be no reasonable
doubt. That there was current in the early Church a &ldquo;Teaching of
the Twelve Apostles&rdquo; appears from Eusebius (<i>H. E.</i> iii, 25)
and Athanasius (<i>Festal Epistle</i> 39, <span class="sc">C.E.</span>
367). There were very good reasons why the Church, as time went on,
should desire to drop the <i>Teaching</i> from her current literature.
It is obviously in origin a purely Jewish document, and the first six
chapters show no trace of Jesuism. We have already stated the reasons
for concluding that the primary &ldquo;Teaching&rdquo; was the official
doctrine of the twelve <i>Jewish</i> apostles of the High Priest to the
Jews dispersed through the Roman Empire; that the Gospels borrowed from
it, and not the converse; that Judaic Jesuists adopted it, and
gradually interpolated it; and that it is the real foundation of the
legend of the twelve Jesuist apostles. The sub-title: &ldquo;Teaching
of [the] Lord through the Twelve Apostles to the Nations&rdquo; may
have been the original. &ldquo;Lord&rdquo; here has the force of
&ldquo;God.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On a first study, we found reasons<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7201src" href="#xd23e7201" name="xd23e7201src">1</a> for deciding
that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>Epistle of Barnabas, which in part closely
coincides with the &ldquo;Teaching,&rdquo; borrows from it, and not the
converse. That view, though naturally opposed by many orthodox
scholars, who want to date the Teaching as late as possible, was from
the first, we find, put by Farrar and by Zahn, and is convincingly
maintained by the American editors, though of course they take the
conventional view that the document is of Christian origin. Yet its
Gr&aelig;co-Jewish origin, we feel certain, will be plain to every
open-minded reader at the first perusal. That view was maintained by
the Rev. Dr. C. Taylor, of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, in two
lectures given at the Royal Institution in 1886; and it has been
accepted by Dr. Salmon in his Introduction to the Study of the New
Testament. It was admitted to be probable by the Rev. A. Gordon, in the
<i>Modern Review</i>, July, 1884, but rejected by the American editors
(1885).</p>
<p class="par">We have followed, with but few serious variations, the
translation of the American editors, Professors Hitchcock and Brown,
which, on careful comparison, we find to be the most faithful. Reasons
for the main variations are given in the notes. Of the elucidatory
notes, some are borrowed (with additions) from the American and French
editions. The English student may refer to the edition of Professors
Hitchcock and Brown, or to that of Canon Spence (1885), for the
literature of the matter. Needless to say, the clerical reasoning on
the matter must be viewed with constant caution.]</p>

For if thou art able to bear the whole yoke of the Lord, thou shalt be

concerning food, what thou art able, bear; but of that offered to
idols, beware exceedingly; for it is a worship of dead Gods.</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">[It will be observed that while there is a very marked
transition after ch. vi, a division may be held to begin after ch. v.
In this connection may be noted an interesting fact, brought out by the
Rev. A. Gordon in his examination of the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>.
Nicephoros of Constantinople (fl. 750&ndash;820) knew of a certain
<i>Teaching of the Apostles</i>, which he mentioned as containing 200
lines. Nicephoros also speaks of the combined lengths of the two
Epistles of Clement as amounting to 2,600 lines. Now, in the Jerusalem
MS., which is closely written, the Clementine Epistles occupy only
1,200 lines, which would give for the <i>Didach&ecirc;</i>, in the same
writing, on the proportions mentioned by Nicephoros, only 92 lines,
whereas it occupies 203. Mr. Gordon simply noted the fact as a
difficulty. If however he had followed up his own observation that the
<i>Didach&ecirc;</i> shows a division after the fifth chapter, he would
have found that the proportion of the first five sections to the rest
is nearly as 86 to 203; while with ch. vi we should have a still closer
approximation&mdash;88 to 203. We have here, then, a virtual proof that
Nicephoros had before him only these first five or six chapters, and
that the subsequent additions were not to be found in all copies of the
<i>Teaching</i>. The inference from the internal evidence is thus
remarkably confirmed. The original <i>Teaching</i>, once more, was a
purely Jewish document, without even a mention of Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">It will be noted further that, while the first six
chapters <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>contain no suggestion of anything beyond simple
monotheism and general ethics, and the sixth chapter ends with a
warning against eating food offered to idols, the seventh suddenly
plunges into a prescription of baptism, which introduces the formula of
&ldquo;the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and minutely
provides for the manner of the ceremony. But the eighth chapter
evidently connects directly with the sixth, a direction as to fasting
following on the warning in that section against eating meat offered to
idols. It is thus perfectly clear that the entire Trinitarian section
on baptism is an interpolation. In the eighth chapter, again, we have
an interpolation of the words &ldquo;as the Lord commanded in his
gospel.&rdquo; In <i>C.M.</i> (415 <i>sq.</i>) are set forth the
weighty reasons for concluding that the Lord&rsquo;s prayer, which is
lacking in Mark, and different in Luke, was a Jewish formula long
before the Christian era.</p>
<p class="par">While the Christist interpolations are thus obvious
after the sixth chapter, it is not here assumed that the first six
chapters as they stand are a single original document. On the contrary,
we are inclined to think that the scheme of the &ldquo;two ways&rdquo;
is itself a redaction of an original document which gave the first
&ldquo;way&rdquo; without preamble, the present preamble and the fifth
chapter being inserted to give the dual form. On that view, the
pre-Christian document may not have stopped with the sixth chapter,
though the definitely Christian redaction begins with the seventh, as
the document now stands. The Trinitarian seventh chapter was almost
certainly one of the latest of the Christian additions. In the ninth,
rules are laid down for the Eucharist without any allusion to the
Godhead of Jesus, who is spoken of in Ebionitic terms as &ldquo;Jesus
thy servant,&rdquo; though Jesus Christ is further on spoken of in more
distinctly Christist terms. These are evidently further additions. In
the tenth chapter the Ebionitic tone is resumed, Jesus being still only
&ldquo;thy servant&rdquo;; while throughout the rest of the document
there is much teaching that might have come from the Judaic apostles
who propagated that of the earlier chapters. As to this, however, it is
difficult to come to a definite conclusion. All that is <span class=

fanatics in foreign lands needed warning from peace-loving teachers. On
the other hand, the rendering &ldquo;jealous&rdquo; is evidently
adopted because of the very difficulty of conceiving that Christian
teachers would warn their flocks against being either
&ldquo;zealous&rdquo; or &ldquo;zealots.&rdquo; The context, however,

<p class="par first">Two questions are raised under this
heading&mdash;the question whether, as was argued by F. C. Baur, the
&ldquo;Simon Magus&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Clementine Recognitions&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Homilies&rdquo; is a mask-name for a polemic directed
primarily at the Apostle Paul; and the more fundamental question
whether the Simon Magus of the Acts is or is not a historical
character.</p>
<p class="par">The reasons for holding Simon to be a mythical personage
(as apart from the reasons for supposing the Clementine Simon to be
meant for Paul, and the story of the Acts to be a misconceiving
adaptation of the Clementine narrative) are overwhelming. To begin
with, Justin Martyr, a Samaritan born, expressly says<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e7824src" href="#xd23e7824" name="xd23e7824src">1</a> that
almost all the Samaritans worshipped Simon.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7829src" href="#xd23e7829" name="xd23e7829src">2</a> This alone
might dispose of the notion that the &ldquo;Simonians&rdquo; dated
merely from the time of Paul and Peter. It is absurd to suppose that
nearly all the Samaritans, a people with old cults, could be converted
within a century to a new Deity originating in one man. The cult must
date further back than that. And that Justin, though of Samaritan
birth, could widely misconceive the cults around him, is pretty clear
from his famous blunder of finding his Simon Magus as <i>Simo
Sanctus</i> in the <i>Semo Sancus</i> of Rome, the old Sabine
counterpart of the Eastern Semo.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7841src"
href="#xd23e7841" name="xd23e7841src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">For there is abundant evidence, to begin with, that a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>name of which the basis is <i>Sem</i> is one of
the oldest of Semitic God-names. We have the forms Shem, Sime-on,
Sams-on, S(h)amas (the Babylonian name of the sun; Hebrew
<i>Shemesh</i>), San-d-on, or Samdan<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7857src" href="#xd23e7857" name="xd23e7857src">4</a> Sem&#275;n
and Sem, all plainly connected with a sun-myth. Shamas or Samas was an
Assyrian Sun-God, the duplicate of Melkarth and Hercules. Samson or
Simson or Shimshai (= the Sun-man), the Hebrew Sun-hero, is
unquestionably a mere variant of that myth. Sand-on, also a Sun-God, is
the same myth over again. Baal-Sam&#275;n, &ldquo;the Lord of
Heaven,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7866src" href="#xd23e7866"
name="xd23e7866src">5</a> is the same conception as Baal-Melkarth;
Baal, &ldquo;the Lord,&rdquo; a Sun-God himself as well as Supreme God,
being joined with the Sun-God proper. The name Sem, again, is found as
signifying Hercules, in conjunction with those of Harpocrates and the
Egyptian Hermes,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7870src" href="#xd23e7870"
name="xd23e7870src">6</a> and is probably involved in the mythical
queen-name Semiramis (Sammuramat), since she in one of the myths gets
her name from Simmas, &ldquo;keeper of the king&rsquo;s flocks,&rdquo;
who rears her<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7873src" href="#xd23e7873"
name="xd23e7873src">7</a>&mdash;another form of the Sun-God, belike.
Simeon, in the myth of the twelve tribes, is one of the twin-brethren,
who in all mythologies are at bottom solar deities. The
&ldquo;on&rdquo; means &ldquo;great,&rdquo; as in Samson, Dagon,
Solomon, etc.;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7876src" href="#xd23e7876"
name="xd23e7876src">8</a> and the Dioscuri of the Greek and Roman myth
were &ldquo;the Great Twin Brethren.&rdquo; It was added to the name of
the Samaritan God &Ecirc;l &Ecirc;lyon, &ldquo;Great
&Ecirc;l,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7881src" href="#xd23e7881"
name="xd23e7881src">9</a> who is just the &Ecirc;l (singular of Elohim)
of the Hebrews. But the name Shem itself means &ldquo;the
Lofty&rdquo;;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7887src" href="#xd23e7887"
name="xd23e7887src">10</a> and the name of the mythical ancestor of the
Shemites is at bottom a God-name, just as are those of Noach, Abram,
Jacob, and Isra-&#275;l. It may also, it appears, have had the
significance of &ldquo;red-shining.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7898src" href="#xd23e7898" name="xd23e7898src">11</a> And, last
but not least, the same vocable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250"
href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>also has the significance of
&ldquo;name,&rdquo; so that the Semites or sons of S(h)em were also
&ldquo;the men with names&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7907src"
href="#xd23e7907" name="xd23e7907src">12</a>; and the Hebrew
&ldquo;Shem hemmaphorash&rdquo; or Tetragrammaton was the name of four
letters (IEUE = Yahweh) or &ldquo;the peculiar name.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e7915src" href="#xd23e7915" name=
"xd23e7915src">13</a> Lenormant declares<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7923src" href="#xd23e7923" name="xd23e7923src">14</a> that this
last tenet came from Chaldea, where &ldquo;they considered the divine
name, the <i>Shem</i>, as endowed with properties so special and
individual that they succeeded in making of it a distinct
person.&rdquo; But this idea of the sacredness of the God-name was one
of the most prevalent of ancient religious notions. It was still
devoutly held by the Christian Origen, who argued<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7931src" href="#xd23e7931" name="xd23e7931src">15</a> that the
Hebrew divine names must be held to because they alone were potent to
conjure with. It appears in the Judaic <span class="sc">Teaching of the
Twelve Apostles</span> in its Christianised form (c. x), in the passage
of thanksgiving beginning, &ldquo;We thank thee, holy Father, for thy
holy <i>name</i>, which thou hast made to dwell in our hearts.&rdquo;
In the Jewish <span class="sc">Sepher Toledoth Jeschu</span>, Jesus is
made to do his magic works by virtue of the &ldquo;Shem
hemmaphorash,&rdquo; the Tetragrammaton, of which he has furtively
possessed himself. Thus could an ancient God-name retain its mysterious
prestige even after the mystery-mongers (reversing the process imagined
by Lenormant) had taken the name-quality out of it, and left only the
word <i>for</i> &ldquo;name.&rdquo; In other ways it clung to the
Jewish cult. It is highly probable that the pre-eminent Jewish prayer,
the &ldquo;Shema&rdquo; (or the &ldquo;Shemoneh Esreh&rdquo;), of which
the name is explained away into insignificance, is an extremely ancient
prayer to the Sun-God.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7949src" href=
"#xd23e7949" name="xd23e7949src">16</a> Even this is sought to be
connected with a historical &ldquo;Simon.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7958src" href="#xd23e7958" name="xd23e7958src">17</a> And all the
while the original God Sem survives in the Jewish mythology as
&ldquo;Shamma-&#275;l,&rdquo; the Prince of Demons and angel of death,
who has power <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name=

Jews;</i><a class="noteref" id="xd23e7966src" href="#xd23e7966" name=
"xd23e7966src">18</a> and at the same time in the legend of Samu-el,
the unshorn, the child of the heretofore sterile mother (vexed by her
rival as Rachel by Leah), the potentate who makes and unmakes kings,
and who is called up as a &ldquo;God&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e7974src" href="#xd23e7974" name="xd23e7974src">19</a> from the
earth by incantation.</p>
<p class="par">But all this connects decisively with Samaria. It is not
improbable that the name Samaria itself was derived from the name of
the Sun-God, it being very much more likely that the mountain would be
named from the God who was worshipped on it than from a man
Shemer.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7981src" href="#xd23e7981" name=
"xd23e7981src">20</a> The last is obviously a worthless gloss. A
reasonable alternative view is that as the God-name Asshur is
identified with the name of the Assyrian country and people, whether
giving or following their race-name, so the Semitic God-name Shem is
bound up with the name Samaria, as that of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; with
Athens. It is at all events clear that, as is claimed by
Volkmar,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e7986src" href="#xd23e7986" name=
"xd23e7986src">21</a> Sem or Simon was the chief God of the Samaritans.
They declared to Antiochus, according to Josephus,<a class="noteref"
id="xd23e7991src" href="#xd23e7991" name="xd23e7991src">22</a> that
their temple on Mount Gerizim had no name, but was that of &ldquo;the
greatest God&rdquo;; and this squares with the other evidence, whether
or not it be true that they offered, as Josephus states, to dedicate
the temple to Zeus of the Hellenes. For, S(h)em being &ldquo;the
high,&rdquo; Sem-on would be the Great High One or Greatest God, just
as &Ecirc;l &Ecirc;lyon was the great &Ecirc;l, <i>the</i> Great Power,
Greatest of Powers. And as Sem-on was also the Great Name, the God was
in that sense without a name, which circumstance is the explanation of
the otherwise pointless phrase of the Johannine Jesus (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%204:22">John iv,
22</a>) to the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;Ye worship that which ye know
not what.&rdquo; And all the ideas converge in the phrases in the Acts
(<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%208:9-10">viii,
9&ndash;10</a>), that Simon claimed to be &ldquo;some great one&rdquo;
(<span class="trans" title="heauton megan"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&#7953;&alpha;&upsilon;&tau;&#8056;&nu;
&mu;&#8051;&gamma;&alpha;&nu;</span></span>) and was spoken of as
&ldquo;that power of God which is called Great.&rdquo; In fine, Simon
<i>Magus</i>, the Mage, is just a version of Simon <i>Megas</i>, Great
Simon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">We know from their version of the Pentateuch that the
later Samaritans, being strong &ldquo;monotheists&rdquo; in one of the
senses of that elastic and misleading term, sought always to substitute
angels for Elohim in the old narratives of divine action (<i>e. g.</i>
<a class="biblink xd23e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%203:5">Gen. iii,
5</a>; <a class="biblink xd23e43" title=

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2017:22">xvii,
22</a>), &ldquo;lest a corporeal existence should be attributed to the
Deity.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8040src" href="#xd23e8040"
name="xd23e8040src">23</a> And it is instructive to note how their
theological drift exhibits itself in early Christism. The doctrine of
the &ldquo;Logos&rdquo; is not merely Alexandrian-Christian, it is
Judaic. Some of the Aramaic paraphrasts of the Old Testament at times
wrote &ldquo;the <i>Word</i> of Jehovah&rdquo; instead of the angel of
Jehovah, sometimes the &ldquo;She-kin-ah,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the
abode of the Word of Jehovah.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e8052src" href="#xd23e8052" name="xd23e8052src">24</a> On the
other hand, we know from the Gospel of Peter that one of the early
Christian sects regarded Jesus as having received his <i lang=
"la">dynamis</i>, his power, at baptism, and yielded it up at
crucifixion. Here we are close to Samaritanism, in which the angels
were regarded<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8058src" href="#xd23e8058"
name="xd23e8058src">25</a> as &ldquo;uncreated influences proceeding
from God (<i lang="grc-latn">dynameis</i>, powers),&rdquo; pretty much
as Simon is described in the Acts. Thus &ldquo;Simon&rdquo; for the
Samaritans would just be &ldquo;&Ecirc;l,&rdquo; which the Samaritan
Justin, like the writer of &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; held to mean
&ldquo;Power.&rdquo; And at the same time, be it observed, Simon was
&ldquo;the Word.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But still the proof abounds. In Lucian&rsquo;s account
of the Syrian Goddess we are told<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8069src"
href="#xd23e8069" name="xd23e8069src">26</a> that in the temple at
Byblos there was a statue, apparently epicene or double-sexed, called
by some Dionysos, by others Deucalion, and by others <i>Semiramis</i>,
but to which the Syrians gave no specific name, calling it only
<i>Semeion</i>, a word which in Greek properly means
&ldquo;sign,&rdquo; but may mean image. There can be little doubt that
Movers<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8080src" href="#xd23e8080" name=
"xd23e8080src">27</a> was right in surmising this statue to be just the
primordial Sem or Sem-on, the Great Sem of the Semitic race. The
two-sexed character is in perfect keeping with the ideal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=
"pb253">253</a>]</span>duality of the old Assyrian
Nature-Gods;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8088src" href="#xd23e8088"
name="xd23e8088src">28</a> and the peculiar detail of the name which
was not a name brings us again to the Sem-on of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="par">Everything in the Christian legend falls in with this
identification. The Fathers<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8093src" href=
"#xd23e8093" name="xd23e8093src">29</a> tell us of one Helen, a
prostitute from Tyre, with whom Simon went about, and whom he gave out
to be a reincarnation of Helen of Troy, and also his
&ldquo;Thought.&rdquo; Helen is almost unquestionably, as Baur<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e8102src" href="#xd23e8102" name=
"xd23e8102src">30</a> surmised, the <i>Selene</i> or <i>Luna</i> of the
old sun-cultus. In the paragraph following his account of the
<i>Semeion</i>, Lucian tells us that in the forepart of the same temple
stands the throne of Helios, but without a statue; Helios and Selene,
the sun and moon, being the only divinities not sculptured in the
temple&mdash;though he goes on to mention that behind the throne is a
statue of a clothed and bearded Apollo, quite different from the Greek
form. Here, again, we have a mystic conception of the Sun-God, a
conception necessarily confusing to ordinary visitors, even supposing
the priests themselves to have had any consistent ideas about it; and
the fact<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8117src" href="#xd23e8117" name=
"xd23e8117src">31</a> that the temple further contained among other
statues one of <i>Helena</i> (herself an old Moon-Goddess), gave ample
opportunity for the usual mythological variants. Thus it came about
that while Justin and Iren&aelig;us connect Simon Magus with
<i>Helen</i>, Iren&aelig;us says the Simonians have &ldquo;an image of
Simon in the likeness of <i>Jupiter</i>, and of Helen in that of
<i>Minerva</i>&rdquo;&mdash;a curious statement, which at once recalls
that of Lucian<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8134src" href="#xd23e8134"
name="xd23e8134src">32</a> that the <i>H&ecirc;r&ecirc;</i> of the
temple of Byblos &ldquo;has something of Ath&ecirc;n&ecirc; and
Aphrodite, of <i>Selene</i> and Rhea, of Artemis, of Nemesis, and of
the Parc&aelig;.&rdquo; This again squares with the fact that in the
Chaldeo-Babylonian system Samas was associated with the goddess Gula,
&ldquo;<i>triform as personating the moon</i>, and sometimes replaced
by a group of three spouses of equal rank, Malkit, Gula, and
Anunit.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8149src" href="#xd23e8149"
name="xd23e8149src">33</a> And in the Latin translation by Rufinus of
the pseudo-Clementine <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href=
"#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>&ldquo;Recognitions,&rdquo; for
Helena we actually have <i>Luna</i>.</p>
<p class="par">The chain is complete. We are dealing not with a
historic person or persons, but with an ancient cult, which Christian
ignorance and Judaic &ldquo;monotheism&rdquo; between them strove to
reduce somehow to a historical narrative, as the myths of Abraham and
Samson and Israel and Elijah and a dozen others had been reduced, as
the mythic ritual had been in the gospels, and as indeed the rituals of
Paganism had been in the current pagan mythologies. There was no
Samaritan Simon the Mage, who met a Christian Peter; it was not a
preaching Simon who taught of himself, but the Samaritan populace who
traditionally believed of their God Sem or Simon, that &ldquo;he
appeared among the Jews as the Son, while in Samaria he descended as
the Father, <i>and in the rest of the nations he came as the Holy
Spirit</i>.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8162src" href=
"#xd23e8162" name="xd23e8162src">34</a> The parallel holds down to the
last jot. The <i>Semeion</i> of the temple of Byblos <i>had a dove on
his head</i>,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8171src" href="#xd23e8171"
name="xd23e8171src">35</a> and there are abundant Jewish charges as to
the worship of a dove by the Samaritans at Mount Gerizim;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd23e8175src" href="#xd23e8175" name=
"xd23e8175src">36</a> so that Simon was the Logos receiving the Holy
Spirit, the <i lang="la">dynamis</i>, just as Jesus did in the Gospels;
and the Christists&rsquo; doctrine that the Holy Spirit should be given
to the nations is simply an adaptation of the Samaritan syncretism,
which they sought to override by a syncretism of their own in their
latest gospel, where it comes out that their Galilean Jesus was
<i>called a Samaritan</i> by Jews,<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8196src"
href="#xd23e8196" name="xd23e8196src">37</a> a charge which curiously
enough he does not dispute, denying only that he has &ldquo;a
daimon.&rdquo; This is exactly the myth of Simon turned into a story of
an incarnate Messiah, who affirms his reality.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="par first">What hinders ordinary students from accepting
Baur&rsquo;s view of the &ldquo;Clementine&rdquo; Simon, which we have
here sought to support, is the existence of the fragments of writings
attributed to Simon, together with the circumstantialities of the story
in the Acts and the Fathers. But these circumstantialities are just the
marks of all the ancient myths, Jewish, Christian, and Gentile; and the
attribution of writings to Simon Magus no more proves his historical
existence than the same process proves the historical existence of
Orpheus and Moses.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8217src" href=
"#xd23e8217" name="xd23e8217src">39</a> The fragments and paraphrases
preserved by the Fathers are just part of the mass of ancient
Occultism; and their connection with the name of Simon the Mage is
merely a variation of the Jewish myth which attributes the authorship
of the Zohar to Simon Ben Jocha&iuml;, a mythical or mythicised
personage if ever there was one. He is fabled to have lived in a cave
for twelve years, studying the Cabbala, during which time he was
visited by Elias. At his death fire was seen in the cave, and a voice
from heaven was heard saying, &ldquo;Come ye to the marriage of Simon
Ben Jocha&iuml;: he is entering into peace, and shall rest in his
chamber.&rdquo; At his burial there was heard a voice crying,
&ldquo;This is he who caused the earth to quake and the kingdoms to
shake.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8223src" href="#xd23e8223"
name="xd23e8223src">40</a> Simon is said to have belonged to the first
century of the Christian era; while the Zohar is held to have been
composed in the 13th century.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8228src" href=
"#xd23e8228" name="xd23e8228src">41</a> In all probability the
<i>matter</i> of the Zohar is largely ancient; and the association of
it (as of the <i>Shema</i> or <i>Shemoneh Esreh</i> prayer) with the
name Simon points distinctly to a traditional vogue of the name in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>Semitic Gnosticism. But there is no more reason
to believe that an actual Simon composed the Zohar, or the &ldquo;Great
Denial&rdquo; (perhaps = antinomy) attributed to Simon the Mage, than
to believe in the above stories of the voices from heaven and those of
the miracles of the Mage in the Acts. The Talmudic legends clearly
point to a sun myth, bringing Simon into connection with Elias,
Eli-jah, an unquestionable Sun-God, who combines the names El and Jah,
though reduced by the Judaic Evemerising monotheists to the rank of a
judge-prophet, as was Samu-el, and as Sams-on was made a
&ldquo;judge.&rdquo; It lay in the essence of ancient religiosity to do
this, and at the same time to seek to father all its documents on
sacrosanct names. That a real Samaritan Simon of the first century
should write a new occultist book and publish it as his own, is
contrary to the whole spirit of the time. Only centuries after the
period of its composition could such a book be attributed to an
ordinary human author by those who accepted it. If it was current in
the first century, it must have been either fathered on an ancient and
mythical Simon or regarded as a book of the mysteries of the God Simon.
The opinions or statements of the Christian Fathers concerning it are
quite worthless save as embodying a name-tradition.</p>

<p class="par first">There remains to be considered the theory of the
T&uuml;bingen school that the Christian legend of Simon Magus is to be
found in its earliest form in the &ldquo;Clementines,&rdquo; that body
of early sectarian forged literature which has been made to yield so
much light as to the early history of the Christist Church. Here, in a
set of writings (&ldquo;Recognitions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Homilies,&rdquo;
of which books one is a redaction of the other), purporting to be by
Clement of Rome, we have a propaganda that is on the face of it
strongly Petrine, and that turns out on analysis to be strongly
anti-Pauline, though the gist of the matter is a series of disputations
between Peter and Simon the Mage. It is impossible at present to settle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>what was the first form of these documents,
which as they stand bear marks of the third century, and survive only
in the Latin translation of Rufinus (d. 410); but it is plain that they
preserve elements of the early Ebionitic or Jud&aelig;o-Christian
opposition to the Gentile Christism of Paul. The T&uuml;bingen theory
is that under the name of Simon Magus Paul is attacked throughout.
This, at first sight, certainly seems a fantastic thesis; but an
examination of the matter shows that it is very strongly founded. A
leading feature in the conduct of Simon Magus in the Clementines, as in
the Acts, is his attempt to purchase apostleship with money. Now, this
corresponds very closely with the act of Paul in bringing to Jerusalem
a subsidy from the Western churches, an act which, on the part of one
not recognised as an apostle, and exhibited in the Epistles as always
on jealous terms<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8253src" href="#xd23e8253"
name="xd23e8253src">42</a> with the Jerusalem apostles, would naturally
rank as an attempt to purchase the Holy Ghost with lucre. Again, Simon
Magus in the Clementines claims to rest his authority on divine
visions, which is exactly the position of Paul;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e8270src" href="#xd23e8270" name="xd23e8270src">43</a> and Peter
denies that visions have such authority. Once recognise the primary
strife between Judaising and Gentilising Christians, of which there are
so many traces in New Testament and Patristic literature, and it is
easy to see that these are the very points on which the anti-Paulinists
would most bitterly oppose Paul and his movement. In the Clementines,
Peter not only opposes the Magus in Palestine, but follows him to Rome,
thus carrying the antagonism between the two sects over the whole
theoretic field. The fact that both Simon Peter and Simon Magus, Cephas
and Paul, are made to journey from East to West, and to die in the
West, like the immemorial Sun-God, is suggestive.</p>
<p class="par">That the Judaists should give Paul a symbolical name,
again, was quite in keeping with the usual dialectic of the time, in
which Rome, for instance, figured as &ldquo;Babylon,&rdquo; the typical
great hostile city of Jewish remembrance. Just as Babylon symbolised
heathen oppression, Samaria <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>typified heathen heresy, the
divergence from the Jewish cult in a heathen direction. Such divergence
was the Judaist gravamen against Paul, who broke away from the law; and
as Simon, Semo, typified Samaritan heresy in general, it was peculiarly
suited to the arch-heretic who sought to overthrow the supreme
privilege of Jerusalem. Simon was the Samaritan &ldquo;false
Christ,&rdquo; and Paul&rsquo;s preaching falsified the Judaic
Christ.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8285src" href="#xd23e8285" name=
"xd23e8285src">44</a> And nothing is more remarkable in the matter than
the way in which the plainly patched-up reconciliatory narrative of the
Acts squares with this theory. The book of Acts is explicable only on
the hypothesis that it was designed, in its final form, to reconcile
the long-opposed sects by reconciling Peter and Paul in a
quasi-historical narrative. The narrative plainly clashes with
Paul&rsquo;s alleged Epistles. For the rest, it is managed largely on
the plan of duplicating the exploits of the two heroes, so that Paul
confutes Elymas as Peter does Simon, and closely duplicates one of
Peter&rsquo;s miracles.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8291src" href=
"#xd23e8291" name="xd23e8291src">45</a> Some legends were in existence
to start with, and others were invented to match them. Similarly the
dispute between Paul and Barnabas at Antioch was to supersede the
strife there between Paul and Peter.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e8299src" href="#xd23e8299" name="xd23e8299src">46</a> If then the
composer of the Acts had before him a legend of Peter confuting Simon
the Mage, it would suit him to retain it, since thus would he best
dissociate the Mage from Paul. But, as Zeller points out, he is
careful, first of all, to place the story of the Mage before
Paul&rsquo;s conversion; and at the same time he shows he knows the
original significance of the charge against Simon Magus as to offering
money, by ignoring the most important of Paul&rsquo;s
subsidies.<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8304src" href="#xd23e8304" name=
"xd23e8304src">47</a></p>
<p class="par">The application of a great mass of the polemic against
Simon Magus in the Clementines is so obvious that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>evasion of the problem by Harnack and Salmon and
others on futile pleas of &ldquo;false appearances&rdquo; and
&ldquo;common-sense&rdquo; is simply a confession of defeat.
Baur&rsquo;s case, after being dismissed on pretexts of
&ldquo;common-sense&rdquo; by those who could not meet it, is
irresistibly restated by Schmiedel, on a full survey of its development
by Lipsius and others. The only solution is, that the Clementines adapt
for new purposes a mass of old anti-Pauline matter. At the time at
which they were redacted, Paul had been established as a
&ldquo;catholic&rdquo; figure; and there could be no such hatred to him
as breathes through the fierce impeachments of the teaching of the
Paulines in the Recognitions and Homilies. For it is at the Epistles
that the bulk of the attacks are directed. What has been done is to use
up, for a new polemic with heretics, a quantity of old anti-Pauline
literature in which the disguising of Paul under the name of Simon
Magus probably blinded the redactors to its purpose. For them Simon was
simply the arch-heretic, and it was against his detested memory and
persisting influence that they operated.</p>
<p class="par">The theory is no doubt a complicated one; but when taken
in its full extent, as recognising the addition of the heresy of the
Gnostic Paulinist Marcion to that of Paul, it is perfectly consistent
with the documents; and there is really no other view worth discussing,
as regards the connection of Simon Magus with Peter. The orthodox
belief that Simon was an actual Samaritan who suddenly persuaded the
people of Samaria to regard him as a divine incarnation, as told in the
Acts, will not explain the mass of identities in the Clementines
between the teaching ascribed to him and the actual Pauline Epistles.
In explaining the choice of the name Simon for Paul by his Judaic
antagonists, the myth-theory is far more helpful than the view of
Simon&rsquo;s historicity. A &ldquo;false God&rdquo; Simon, the God of
the typically misbelieving Samaritans, would be by Jews reduced to
human status as a matter of course, unless he were simply classed as a
&ldquo;daimon.&rdquo; A &ldquo;Simon the Mage&rdquo; was for them just
the type they wanted wherewith to identify Paul, the new False Teacher.
To identify, on the other hand, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260"
href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>contemporary or lately
deceased Paul with a contemporary or lately deceased Simon would be an
idle device, missing the end in view. The name of such a Simon would
for purposes of aspersion be worth little or nothing. The name had to
be a widely and long notorious one, and the myth supplied it.</p>

<p class="par first">In conclusion, let it be noted that the bearing of
the myth of Simon Magus on Christianity is not limited to the
explanation of the Samaritan origins and the elucidation of the
Paul-and-Peter antagonism. The more the matter is looked into, the more
reason is seen for surmising that Samaria played a large part in the
beginnings of the Christian system. Samaria seems to have been beyond
all other parts of Palestine a crucible in which manifold cult-elements
tended to be fused by syncretic ideas; and the extent to which Samaria
figures in the fourth gospel is a phenomenon not yet adequately
explained. The fact that Jesus is there said to have been called a
Samaritan reminds us that among the movements of the &ldquo;false
Christs&rdquo; so often alluded to in the Gospels<a class="noteref" id=
"xd23e8341src" href="#xd23e8341" name="xd23e8341src">48</a> a Samaritan
cult of the mystic Christ may have counted for much. The fourth gospel
itself would come under the anti-Pauline ban, inasmuch as, while Simon
Magus is said to have sought to substitute Mount Gerizim for Jerusalem,
Jesus here<a class="noteref" id="xd23e8347src" href="#xd23e8347" name=
"xd23e8347src">49</a> is made to set aside both the Samaritan mountain
and Jerusalem. The very fact that the Samaritan woman professedly
expects the coming of Messiah, is a hint that the story of the well and
the living water may be of Samaritan Messianic origin. Nay more, since
we know that the Samaritans in particular laid stress on the Messiah
Ben Joseph rather than on the Messiah Ben David, they regarding
themselves as of Josephite descent, it is probable that the very legend
of Jesus being the putative son of one Joseph, which we know was absent
from the Ebionite version of Matthew, was framed to meet the Samaritan
view. These matters are still far from having been exhaustively
considered. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
